### [1] [Input-Specific and Universal Adversarial Attack Generation for Spiking Neural Networks in the Spiking Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06299)
*Spyridon Raptis,Haralampos-G. Stratigopoulos*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 该论文提出了两种针对脉冲神经网络（SNNs）的新型对抗攻击算法，分别针对特定输入和通用输入，并在多个评估指标上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着SNNs应用的普及，了解其安全漏洞（尤其是对抗攻击）变得至关重要。

Method: 提出两种梯度算法：一种针对特定输入生成对抗样本，另一种生成可重复使用的通用对抗补丁。

Result: 在NMNIST、IBM DVS Gesture和SHD数据集上，新算法在对抗准确性、隐蔽性和生成时间上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 论文首次展示了在声音域中生成对抗攻击的可行性，并验证了新算法的优越性。

Abstract: As Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) gain traction across various applications,
understanding their security vulnerabilities becomes increasingly important. In
this work, we focus on the adversarial attacks, which is perhaps the most
concerning threat. An adversarial attack aims at finding a subtle input
perturbation to fool the network's decision-making. We propose two novel
adversarial attack algorithms for SNNs: an input-specific attack that crafts
adversarial samples from specific dataset inputs and a universal attack that
generates a reusable patch capable of inducing misclassification across most
inputs, thus offering practical feasibility for real-time deployment. The
algorithms are gradient-based operating in the spiking domain proving to be
effective across different evaluation metrics, such as adversarial accuracy,
stealthiness, and generation time. Experimental results on two widely used
neuromorphic vision datasets, NMNIST and IBM DVS Gesture, show that our
proposed attacks surpass in all metrics all existing state-of-the-art methods.
Additionally, we present the first demonstration of adversarial attack
generation in the sound domain using the SHD dataset.

*Zhenhua Xu,Zhebo Wang,Maike Li,Wenpeng Xing,Chunqiang Hu,Chen Zhi,Meng Han*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 提出RAP-SM框架，为一系列LLMs提取公共指纹，增强对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单模型指纹方法难以捕捉多模型共性，需更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: RAP-SM通过影子模型提取公共指纹，捕捉多模型共性。

Result: 实验显示RAP-SM有效捕捉模型共性，且对抗鲁棒性强。

Conclusion: RAP-SM为可扩展指纹验证提供新途径，增强LLMs时代的知识产权保护。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have underscored the
importance of safeguarding intellectual property rights through robust
fingerprinting techniques. Traditional fingerprint verification approaches
typically focus on a single model, seeking to improve the robustness of its
fingerprint.However, these single-model methods often struggle to capture
intrinsic commonalities across multiple related models. In this paper, we
propose RAP-SM (Robust Adversarial Prompt via Shadow Models), a novel framework
that extracts a public fingerprint for an entire series of LLMs. Experimental
results demonstrate that RAP-SM effectively captures the intrinsic
commonalities among different models while exhibiting strong adversarial
robustness. Our findings suggest that RAP-SM presents a valuable avenue for
scalable fingerprint verification, offering enhanced protection against
potential model breaches in the era of increasingly prevalent LLMs.

### [3] [User Behavior Analysis in Privacy Protection with Large Language Models: A Study on Privacy Preferences with Limited Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06305)
*Haowei Yang,Qingyi Lu,Yang Wang,Sibei Liu,Jiayun Zheng,Ao Xiang*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 研究探讨了在数据有限环境下，利用大语言模型（LLMs）分析用户隐私保护行为的方法，结合Few-shot学习和隐私计算，显著提高了隐私偏好建模的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，用户隐私保护成为重要研究课题，现有方法依赖大规模数据，难以在数据有限环境下有效分析隐私偏好。

Method: 结合Few-shot学习和隐私计算，利用匿名用户隐私设置数据、调查响应和模拟数据，比较传统方法与LLM方法的性能。

Result: 实验表明，即使在数据有限情况下，LLMs显著提高了隐私偏好建模的准确性，结合差分隐私和联邦学习进一步降低了数据暴露风险。

Conclusion: 研究为LLMs在隐私保护中的应用提供了新思路，并为隐私计算和用户行为分析提供了理论支持。

Abstract: With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs), user privacy
protection has become a significant research topic. Existing privacy preference
modeling methods often rely on large-scale user data, making effective privacy
preference analysis challenging in data-limited environments. This study
explores how LLMs can analyze user behavior related to privacy protection in
scenarios with limited data and proposes a method that integrates Few-shot
Learning and Privacy Computing to model user privacy preferences. The research
utilizes anonymized user privacy settings data, survey responses, and simulated
data, comparing the performance of traditional modeling approaches with
LLM-based methods. Experimental results demonstrate that, even with limited
data, LLMs significantly improve the accuracy of privacy preference modeling.
Additionally, incorporating Differential Privacy and Federated Learning further
reduces the risk of user data exposure. The findings provide new insights into
the application of LLMs in privacy protection and offer theoretical support for
advancing privacy computing and user behavior analysis.

### [4] [Large Language Model-driven Security Assistant for Internet of Things via Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06307)
*Mingfei Zeng,Ming Xie,Xixi Zheng,Chunhai Li,Chuan Zhang,Liehuang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的物联网（IoT）安全助手ICoT，通过分解安全漏洞的多个维度，提升LLM对IoT安全问题的理解，并提供个性化解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着IoT技术的快速发展，其安全性问题日益突出，现有方法难以适应复杂动态的安全场景，亟需自动、高效且准确的安全解决方案。

Method: 提出ICoT方法，通过分解安全漏洞的多维度信息，指导LLM逐步分析和推理复杂安全场景，生成针对用户需求和专业水平的个性化响应。

Result: 实验表明，相比单纯依赖LLM的方法，ICoT显著提升了对IoT安全问题的理解，并提供更准确、可靠且个性化的解决方案。

Conclusion: ICoT方法通过增强LLM对IoT安全的理解能力，为动态复杂的安全场景提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has transformed
people's way of life and has a profound impact on both production and daily
activities. However, with the rapid advancement of IoT technology, the security
of IoT devices has become an unavoidable issue in both research and
applications. Although some efforts have been made to detect or mitigate IoT
security vulnerabilities, they often struggle to adapt to the complexity of IoT
environments, especially when dealing with dynamic security scenarios. How to
automatically, efficiently, and accurately understand these vulnerabilities
remains a challenge. To address this, we propose an IoT security assistant
driven by Large Language Model (LLM), which enhances the LLM's understanding of
IoT security vulnerabilities and related threats. The aim of the ICoT method we
propose is to enable the LLM to understand security issues by breaking down the
various dimensions of security vulnerabilities and generating responses
tailored to the user's specific needs and expertise level. By incorporating
ICoT, LLM can gradually analyze and reason through complex security scenarios,
resulting in more accurate, in-depth, and personalized security recommendations
and solutions. Experimental results show that, compared to methods relying
solely on LLM, our proposed LLM-driven IoT security assistant significantly
improves the understanding of IoT security issues through the ICoT approach and
provides personalized solutions based on the user's identity, demonstrating
higher accuracy and reliability.

### [5] [Defending against Indirect Prompt Injection by Instruction Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06311)
*Tongyu Wen,Chenglong Wang,Xiyuan Yang,Haoyu Tang,Yueqi Xie,Lingjuan Lyu,Zhicheng Dou,Fangzhao Wu*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种利用LLMs的行为状态检测间接提示注入攻击（IPI）的新方法，通过结合隐藏状态和梯度特征，实现了高检测准确率和低攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs与外部数据源的集成（如RAG），IPI攻击的风险增加，隐藏指令可能操纵LLMs执行有害行为。研究旨在通过检测LLMs行为状态变化来防御此类攻击。

Method: 通过分析LLMs在正向和反向传播中的行为状态（隐藏状态和梯度），提取特征以检测潜在IPI攻击。

Result: 在BIPIA基准测试中，检测准确率达到99.60%（域内）和96.90%（域外），攻击成功率降至0.12%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效检测IPI攻击，显著降低攻击成功率，为LLMs的安全集成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with external sources is
becoming increasingly common, with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) being a
prominent example. However, this integration introduces vulnerabilities of
Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks, where hidden instructions embedded in
external data can manipulate LLMs into executing unintended or harmful actions.
We recognize that the success of IPI attacks fundamentally relies in the
presence of instructions embedded within external content, which can alter the
behavioral state of LLMs. Can effectively detecting such state changes help us
defend against IPI attacks? In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
takes external data as input and leverages the behavioral state of LLMs during
both forward and backward propagation to detect potential IPI attacks.
Specifically, we demonstrate that the hidden states and gradients from
intermediate layers provide highly discriminative features for instruction
detection. By effectively combining these features, our approach achieves a
detection accuracy of 99.60\% in the in-domain setting and 96.90\% in the
out-of-domain setting, while reducing the attack success rate to just 0.12\% on
the BIPIA benchmark.

### [6] [Threat Modeling for AI: The Case for an Asset-Centric Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06315)
*Jose Sanchez Vicarte,Marcin Spoczynski,Mostafa Elsaid*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文提出了一种以资产为中心的威胁建模方法，用于应对集成AI代理带来的独特安全挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代理能力的提升，其能够自主决策和执行操作，传统安全方法已无法满足需求，亟需新的安全框架。

Method: 采用自下而上的方法，系统性识别漏洞对关键AI资产的影响，支持跨技术领域的全面分析。

Result: 该方法能有效量化第三方AI组件的安全假设，并识别特定产品环境中的AI漏洞。

Conclusion: 以资产为中心的威胁建模方法适用于具有复杂自主能力的AI系统，能够适应快速演变的威胁环境。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI are transforming AI's ubiquitous presence in our world
from that of standalone AI-applications into deeply integrated AI-agents. These
changes have been driven by agents' increasing capability to autonomously make
decisions and initiate actions, using existing applications; whether those
applications are AI-based or not. This evolution enables unprecedented levels
of AI integration, with agents now able to take actions on behalf of systems
and users -- including, in some cases, the powerful ability for the AI to write
and execute scripts as it deems necessary. With AI systems now able to
autonomously execute code, interact with external systems, and operate without
human oversight, traditional security approaches fall short.
  This paper introduces an asset-centric methodology for threat modeling AI
systems that addresses the unique security challenges posed by integrated AI
agents. Unlike existing top-down frameworks that analyze individual attacks
within specific product contexts, our bottom-up approach enables defenders to
systematically identify how vulnerabilities -- both conventional and
AI-specific -- impact critical AI assets across distributed infrastructures
used to develop and deploy these agents. This methodology allows security teams
to: (1) perform comprehensive analysis that communicates effectively across
technical domains, (2) quantify security assumptions about third-party AI
components without requiring visibility into their implementation, and (3)
holistically identify AI-based vulnerabilities relevant to their specific
product context. This approach is particularly relevant for securing agentic
systems with complex autonomous capabilities. By focusing on assets rather than
attacks, our approach scales with the rapidly evolving threat landscape while
accommodating increasingly complex and distributed AI development pipelines.

### [7] [LATENT: LLM-Augmented Trojan Insertion and Evaluation Framework for Analog Netlist Topologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06364)
*Jayeeta Chaudhuri,Arjun Chaudhuri,Krishnendu Chakrabarty*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: LATENT是一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的框架，用于生成隐蔽的模拟特洛伊木马，填补了模拟特洛伊木马研究领域的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟和混合信号集成电路在安全关键应用中至关重要，但其外包给不可信的第三方代工厂使其面临模拟特洛伊木马的威胁。目前对模拟特洛伊木马的研究不足，缺乏多样化的实例阻碍了防御技术的发展。

Method: LATENT利用LLM作为自主代理，在模拟设计中智能插入和优化特洛伊木马组件，并通过检测模型的反馈迭代改进，确保其隐蔽性和规避检测能力。

Result: 实验结果显示，生成的木马设计平均激活范围为15.74%，在大多数工作电压下保持不活跃，但激活时会导致11.3%的性能下降。

Conclusion: LATENT为模拟特洛伊木马的研究和防御提供了新的工具和思路，填补了该领域的空白。

Abstract: Analog and mixed-signal (A/MS) integrated circuits (ICs) are integral to
safety-critical applications. However, the globalization and outsourcing of
A/MS ICs to untrusted third-party foundries expose them to security threats,
particularly analog Trojans. Unlike digital Trojans which have been extensively
studied, analog Trojans remain largely unexplored. There has been only limited
research on their diversity and stealth in analog designs, where a Trojan is
activated only during a narrow input voltage range. Effective defense
techniques require a clear understanding of the attack vectors; however, the
lack of diverse analog Trojan instances limits robust advances in detection
strategies. To address this gap, we present LATENT, the first large language
model (LLM)-driven framework for crafting stealthy, circuit-specific analog
Trojans. LATENT incorporates LLM as an autonomous agent to intelligently insert
and refine Trojan components within analog designs based on iterative feedback
from a detection model. This feedback loop ensures that the inserted Trojans
remain stealthy while successfully evading detection. Experimental results
demonstrate that our generated Trojan designs exhibit an average
Trojan-activation range of 15.74%, ensuring they remain inactive under most
operating voltages, while causing a significant performance degradation of
11.3% upon activation.

### [8] [NCorr-FP: A Neighbourhood-based Correlation-preserving Fingerprinting Scheme for Intellectual Property Protection of Structured Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06379)
*Tanja Šarčević,Andreas Rauber,Rudolf Mayer*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: NCorr-FP是一种基于邻域相关性的指纹系统，用于结构化表格数据，旨在保护统计保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决共享数据环境中数据所有权和未经授权重新分发的追踪问题。

Method: 利用局部记录相似性和密度估计嵌入指纹位，并通过反向逻辑提取指纹。

Result: 指纹几乎不可察觉，保持高数据效用，对删除和攻击具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NCorr-FP在混合类型数据集上表现优异，适用于实际数据场景。

Abstract: Ensuring data ownership and traceability of unauthorised redistribution are
central to safeguarding intellectual property in shared data environments. Data
fingerprinting addresses these challenges by embedding recipient-specific marks
into the data, typically via content modifications. We propose NCorr-FP, a
Neighbourhood-based Correlation-preserving Fingerprinting system for structured
tabular data with the main goal of preserving statistical fidelity. The method
uses local record similarity and density estimation to guide the insertion of
fingerprint bits. The embedding logic is then reversed to extract the
fingerprint from a potentially modified dataset. Extensive experiments confirm
its effectiveness, fidelity, utility and robustness. Results show that
fingerprints are virtually imperceptible, with minute Hellinger distances and
KL divergences, even at high embedding ratios. The system also maintains high
data utility for downstream predictive tasks. The method achieves 100\%
detection confidence under substantial data deletions and remains robust
against adaptive and collusion attacks. Satisfying all these requirements
concurrently on mixed-type datasets highlights the strong applicability of
NCorr-FP to real-world data settings.

Method: 提出了一种综合框架，包括弱点评估、渗透测试和红队演练等方法，专门针对AI系统的脆弱性进行测试。

Result: 通过模拟真实攻击场景，揭示了关键漏洞，为制定更强防御策略提供了依据，提升了AI系统的抗威胁能力。

Conclusion: 该框架将进攻性AI安全从理论转化为实践，为组织提供了可操作的方法，以增强其AI系统对新兴威胁的抵御能力。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly adopted across
sectors, the need for robust, proactive security strategies is paramount.
Traditional defensive measures often fall short against the unique and evolving
threats facing AI-driven technologies, making offensive security an essential
approach for identifying and mitigating risks. This paper presents a
comprehensive framework for offensive security in AI systems, emphasizing
proactive threat simulation and adversarial testing to uncover vulnerabilities
throughout the AI lifecycle. We examine key offensive security techniques,
including weakness and vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, and red
teaming, tailored specifically to address AI's unique susceptibilities. By
simulating real-world attack scenarios, these methodologies reveal critical
insights, informing stronger defensive strategies and advancing resilience
against emerging threats. This framework advances offensive AI security from
theoretical concepts to practical, actionable methodologies that organizations
can implement to strengthen their AI systems against emerging threats.

Result: 提出了一种人机协作的愿景，AI通过合作提升SOC任务表现。

Conclusion: 邀请SOC合作，进一步开发可复制的人机协作模式以提升生产力。

Abstract: Security Operations Centers (SOCs) face growing challenges in managing
cybersecurity threats due to an overwhelming volume of alerts, a shortage of
skilled analysts, and poorly integrated tools. Human-AI collaboration offers a
promising path to augment the capabilities of SOC analysts while reducing their
cognitive overload. To this end, we introduce an AI-driven human-machine
co-teaming paradigm that leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance
threat intelligence, alert triage, and incident response workflows. We present
a vision in which LLM-based AI agents learn from human analysts the tacit
knowledge embedded in SOC operations, enabling the AI agents to improve their
performance on SOC tasks through this co-teaming. We invite SOCs to collaborate
with us to further develop this process and uncover replicable patterns where
human-AI co-teaming yields measurable improvements in SOC productivity.

security and assurance frameworks. This paper presents an enterprise-level,
risk-aware, security-by-design approach for large-scale autonomous AI systems,
integrating standardized threat metrics, adversarial hardening techniques, and
real-time anomaly detection into every phase of the development lifecycle. We
detail a unified pipeline - from design-time risk assessments and secure
training protocols to continuous monitoring and automated audit logging - that
delivers provable guarantees of model behavior under adversarial and
operational stress. Case studies in national security, open-source model
governance, and industrial automation demonstrate measurable reductions in
vulnerability and compliance overhead. Finally, we advocate cross-sector
collaboration - uniting engineering teams, standards bodies, and regulatory
agencies - to institutionalize these technical safeguards within a resilient,
end-to-end assurance ecosystem for the next generation of AI.

*Mohammed Elnawawy,Gargi Mitra,Shahrear Iqbal,Karthik Pattabiraman*

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 提出了一种基于风险感知的选择性训练框架，结合静态和动态防御的优点，提高DNN对规避攻击的检测率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNN在安全关键应用中易受规避攻击，现有静态防御效率高但适应性差，动态防御适应性好但计算开销大。

Method: 使用风险感知策略选择性训练静态防御，专注于更具韧性的实例。

Result: 在血糖管理系统中，选择性训练使召回率提高27.5%，且对精度影响最小。

Conclusion: 选择性训练能有效减少假阴性，提升安全关键应用中的防御效果。

Abstract: Safety-critical applications such as healthcare and autonomous vehicles use
deep neural networks (DNN) to make predictions and infer decisions. DNNs are
susceptible to evasion attacks, where an adversary crafts a malicious data
instance to trick the DNN into making wrong decisions at inference time.
Existing defenses that protect DNNs against evasion attacks are either static
or dynamic. Static defenses are computationally efficient but do not adapt to
the evolving threat landscape, while dynamic defenses are adaptable but suffer
from an increased computational overhead. To combine the best of both worlds,
in this paper, we propose a novel risk profiling framework that uses a
risk-aware strategy to selectively train static defenses using victim instances
that exhibit the most resilient features and are hence more resilient against
an evasion attack. We hypothesize that training existing defenses on instances
that are less vulnerable to the attack enhances the adversarial detection rate
by reducing false negatives. We evaluate the efficacy of our risk-aware
selective training strategy on a blood glucose management system that
demonstrates how training static anomaly detectors indiscriminately may result
in an increased false negative rate, which could be life-threatening in
safety-critical applications. Our experiments show that selective training on
the less vulnerable patients achieves a recall increase of up to 27.5\% with
minimal impact on precision compared to indiscriminate training.

### [14] [System Prompt Poisoning: Persistent Attacks on Large Language Models Beyond User Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06493)

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 该论文提出了一种针对大型语言模型（LLMs）的新攻击方式——系统提示中毒，区别于传统的用户提示注入攻击，它通过污染系统提示持久影响所有后续用户交互和模型响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在多样化领域的广泛应用，其安全性问题日益突出，但现有研究主要关注用户提示和模型输出的威胁，而系统提示的安全性被忽视。

Method: 论文系统研究了四种实际攻击策略，并在生成型和推理型LLMs上进行了验证。

Result: 研究表明，系统提示中毒攻击高度可行且有效，即使在使用高级提示技术（如链式思考）的情况下仍能成功。

Conclusion: 系统提示中毒攻击削弱了包括链式思考和检索增强生成在内的先进提示技术的有效性，揭示了LLMs在系统提示安全性上的重大漏洞。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread adoption across diverse
applications due to their impressive generative capabilities. Their
plug-and-play nature enables both developers and end users to interact with
these models through simple prompts. However, as LLMs become more integrated
into various systems in diverse domains, concerns around their security are
growing. Existing studies mainly focus on threats arising from user prompts
(e.g. prompt injection attack) and model output (e.g. model inversion attack),
while the security of system prompts remains largely overlooked. This work
bridges the critical gap. We introduce system prompt poisoning, a new attack
vector against LLMs that, unlike traditional user prompt injection, poisons
system prompts hence persistently impacts all subsequent user interactions and
model responses. We systematically investigate four practical attack strategies
in various poisoning scenarios. Through demonstration on both generative and
reasoning LLMs, we show that system prompt poisoning is highly feasible without
requiring jailbreak techniques, and effective across a wide range of tasks,
including those in mathematics, coding, logical reasoning, and natural language
processing. Importantly, our findings reveal that the attack remains effective
even when user prompts employ advanced prompting techniques like
chain-of-thought (CoT). We also show that such techniques, including CoT and
retrieval-augmentation-generation (RAG), which are proven to be effective for
improving LLM performance in a wide range of tasks, are significantly weakened
in their effectiveness by system prompt poisoning.

Conclusion: LASE为安全领域提供了低成本威胁分析工具，并鼓励进一步研究以构建行为分析目录。

Abstract: Over the years, adversarial attempts against critical services have become
more effective and sophisticated in launching low-profile attacks. This trend
has always been concerning. However, an even more alarming trend is the
increasing difficulty of collecting relevant evidence about these attacks and
the involved threat actors in the early stages before significant damage is
done. This issue puts defenders at a significant disadvantage, as it becomes
exceedingly difficult to understand the attack details and formulate an
appropriate response. Developing robust forensics tools to collect evidence
about modern threats has never been easy. One main challenge is to provide a
robust trade-off between achieving sufficient visibility while leaving minimal
detectable artifacts. This paper will introduce LASE, an open-source
Low-Artifact Forensics Engine to perform threat analysis and forensics in
Windows operating system. LASE augments current analysis tools by providing
detailed, system-wide monitoring capabilities while minimizing detectable
artifacts. We designed multiple deployment scenarios, showing LASE's potential
in evidence gathering and threat reasoning in a real-world setting. By making
LASE and its execution trace data available to the broader research community,
this work encourages further exploration in the field by reducing the
engineering costs for threat analysis and building a longitudinal behavioral
analysis catalog for diverse security domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various
domains, primarily due to their strong capabilities in reasoning and generating
human-like text. Despite their impressive performance, LLMs are susceptible to
hallucinations, which can lead to incorrect or misleading outputs. This is
primarily due to the lack of up-to-date knowledge or domain-specific
information. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising approach to
mitigate hallucinations by leveraging external knowledge sources. However, the
security of RAG systems has not been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we
study a poisoning attack on RAG systems named POISONCRAFT, which can mislead
the model to refer to fraudulent websites. Compared to existing poisoning
attacks on RAG systems, our attack is more practical as it does not require
access to the target user query's info or edit the user query. It not only
ensures that injected texts can be retrieved by the model, but also ensures
that the LLM will be misled to refer to the injected texts in its response. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of POISONCRAFTacross different datasets,
retrievers, and language models in RAG pipelines, and show that it remains
effective when transferred across retrievers, including black-box systems.
Moreover, we present a case study revealing how the attack influences both the
retrieval behavior and the step-by-step reasoning trace within the generation
model, and further evaluate the robustness of POISONCRAFTunder multiple defense
mechanisms. These results validate the practicality of our threat model and
highlight a critical security risk for RAG systems deployed in real-world
applications. We release our
code\footnote{https://github.com/AndyShaw01/PoisonCraft} to support future
research on the security and robustness of RAG systems in real-world settings.

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆的普及带来了安全和可靠性问题，需解决这些问题以确保公共安全并促进其广泛应用。

Method: 开发了一个结合AI（LSTM网络）和区块链的框架，用于实时异常检测、数据存储和自动响应。

Result: 框架能有效检测异常（如网络攻击和硬件故障），并通过区块链确保数据不可篡改和透明。

Conclusion: 该框架提升了自动驾驶系统的安全性和可靠性，但也面临数据规模、计算资源和隐私等挑战。

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AV) proliferation brings important and pressing security
and reliability issues that must be dealt with to guarantee public safety and
help their widespread adoption. The contribution of the proposed research is
towards achieving more secure, reliable, and trustworthy autonomous
transportation system by providing more capabilities for anomaly detection,
data provenance, and real-time response in safety critical AV deployments. In
this research, we develop a new framework that combines the power of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) for real-time anomaly detection with blockchain technology to
detect and prevent any malicious activity including sensor failures in AVs.
Through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, our approach continually
monitors associated multi-sensor data streams to detect anomalous patterns that
may represent cyberattacks as well as hardware malfunctions. Further, this
framework employs a decentralized platform for securely storing sensor data and
anomaly alerts in a blockchain ledger for data incorruptibility and
authenticity, while offering transparent forensic features. Moreover, immediate
automated response mechanisms are deployed using smart contracts when anomalies
are found. This makes the AV system more resilient to attacks from both
cyberspace and hardware component failure. Besides, we identify potential
challenges of scalability in handling high frequency sensor data, computational
constraint in resource constrained environment, and of distributed data storage
in terms of privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在智能工业与自动驾驶等环境中，IoRT面临网络入侵风险，可能导致数据泄露、服务中断甚至物理损害。现有方法难以满足本地无标记数据及隐私保护的需求。

Method: CFedSSL-NID结合随机弱增强与强增强、潜在对比学习和EMA更新，整合监督信号，提升机器人本地未标记数据的性能与鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，CFedSSL-NID在基准数据集上优于现有的联邦半监督和全监督方法，且资源需求更低。

Conclusion: CFedSSL-NID为IoRT提供了一种高效、隐私保护的入侵检测解决方案。

Abstract: In intelligent industry, autonomous driving and other environments, the
Internet of Things (IoT) highly integrated with robotic to form the Internet of
Robotic Things (IoRT). However, network intrusion to IoRT can lead to data
leakage, service interruption in IoRT and even physical damage by controlling
robots or vehicles. This paper proposes a Contrastive Federated Semi-Supervised
Learning Network Intrusion Detection framework (CFedSSL-NID) for IoRT intrusion
detection and defense, to address the practical scenario of IoRT where robots
don't possess labeled data locally and the requirement for data privacy
preserving. CFedSSL-NID integrates randomly weak and strong augmentation,
latent contrastive learning, and EMA update to integrate supervised signals,
thereby enhancing performance and robustness on robots' local unlabeled data.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CFedSSL-NID outperforms existing
federated semi-supervised and fully supervised methods on benchmark dataset and
has lower resource requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在多种任务中表现出色，但其存在安全漏洞，尤其是“思维停止”漏洞。现有攻击方法效率低且易被检测，亟需改进。

Method: 通过实验验证并修正了先前对漏洞根源的分析，提出了一种基于“推理令牌溢出”效应的新型攻击方法，仅需109个令牌即可实现攻击。

Result: 实验证明，新攻击方法高效且隐蔽，同时发现官方与非官方部署在触发RTO效应上存在差异。此外，还构建了一种新型越狱攻击。

Conclusion: 研究为提升大型语言模型的安全性提供了重要启示，揭示了新漏洞及其利用方法。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (RLLMs) have demonstrated outstanding
performance across a variety of tasks, yet they also expose numerous security
vulnerabilities. Most of these vulnerabilities have centered on the generation
of unsafe content. However, recent work has identified a distinct
"thinking-stopped" vulnerability in DeepSeek-R1: under adversarial prompts, the
model's reasoning process ceases at the system level and produces an empty
final answer. Building upon this vulnerability, researchers developed a novel
prompt injection attack, termed reasoning interruption attack, and also offered
an initial analysis of its root cause. Through extensive experiments, we verify
the previous analyses, correct key errors based on three experimental findings,
and present a more rigorous explanation of the fundamental causes driving the
vulnerability. Moreover, existing attacks typically require over 2,000 tokens,
impose significant overhead, reduce practicality, and are easily detected. To
overcome these limitations, we propose the first practical reasoning
interruption attack. It succeeds with just 109 tokens by exploiting our newly
uncovered "reasoning token overflow" (RTO) effect to overwrite the model's
final answer, forcing it to return an invalid response. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed attack is highly effective. Furthermore, we
discover that the method for triggering RTO differs between the official
DeepSeek-R1 release and common unofficial deployments. As a broadened
application of RTO, we also construct a novel jailbreak attack that enables the
transfer of unsafe content within the reasoning tokens into final answer,
thereby exposing it to the user. Our work carries significant implications for
enhancing the security of RLLMs.

TLDR: RuleGenie是一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的推荐系统，用于优化SIEM规则集，减少冗余规则和误报率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SIEM系统中的冗余规则导致误报率高、分析师疲劳和计算开销增加，但现有优化方法依赖人工，效率低下且易出错。

Method: 利用Transformer模型的多头注意力生成规则嵌入，通过相似性匹配算法识别相似规则，LLM分析规则相似性、威胁覆盖和性能指标，提供优化建议。

Result: 实验表明，RuleGenie能有效识别冗余规则，降低误报率并提升规则效率，适用于多种SIEM平台。

Conclusion: RuleGenie自动化优化SIEM规则集，提升安全团队效率，增强组织安全防护能力。

Abstract: SIEM systems serve as a critical hub, employing rule-based logic to detect
and respond to threats. Redundant or overlapping rules in SIEM systems lead to
excessive false alerts, degrading analyst performance due to alert fatigue, and
increase computational overhead and response latency for actual threats. As a
result, optimizing SIEM rule sets is essential for efficient operations.
Despite the importance of such optimization, research in this area is limited,
with current practices relying on manual optimization methods that are both
time-consuming and error-prone due to the scale and complexity of
enterprise-level rule sets. To address this gap, we present RuleGenie, a novel
large language model (LLM) aided recommender system designed to optimize SIEM
rule sets. Our approach leverages transformer models' multi-head attention
capabilities to generate SIEM rule embeddings, which are then analyzed using a
similarity matching algorithm to identify the top-k most similar rules. The LLM
then processes the rules identified, utilizing its information extraction,
language understanding, and reasoning capabilities to analyze rule similarity,
evaluate threat coverage and performance metrics, and deliver optimized
recommendations for refining the rule set. By automating the rule optimization
process, RuleGenie allows security teams to focus on more strategic tasks while
enhancing the efficiency of SIEM systems and strengthening organizations'
security posture. We evaluated RuleGenie on a comprehensive set of real-world
SIEM rule formats, including Splunk, Sigma, and AQL (Ariel query language),
demonstrating its platform-agnostic capabilities and adaptability across
diverse security infrastructures. Our experimental results show that RuleGenie
can effectively identify redundant rules, which in turn decreases false
positive rates and enhances overall rule efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本地LLM在隐私敏感任务中日益流行，但其硬件缓存侧信道的安全性尚未被充分研究。

Method: 通过分析令牌嵌入操作的缓存访问模式和自回归解码阶段的时间，设计了一种针对开源和专有LLM的窃听攻击框架。

Result: 攻击在多个本地LLM部署（如Llama、Falcon和Gemma）中表现优异，恢复的输入和输出文本与真实值的平均编辑距离分别为17.3%和5.2%，余弦相似度高达98.7%和98.0%。

Conclusion: 本地LLM存在严重的侧信道漏洞，可能泄露用户隐私，需进一步研究防御措施。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) that can be deployed locally have recently
gained popularity for privacy-sensitive tasks, with companies such as Meta,
Google, and Intel playing significant roles in their development. However, the
security of local LLMs through the lens of hardware cache side-channels remains
unexplored. In this paper, we unveil novel side-channel vulnerabilities in
local LLM inference: token value and token position leakage, which can expose
both the victim's input and output text, thereby compromising user privacy.
Specifically, we found that adversaries can infer the token values from the
cache access patterns of the token embedding operation, and deduce the token
positions from the timing of autoregressive decoding phases. To demonstrate the
potential of these leaks, we design a novel eavesdropping attack framework
targeting both open-source and proprietary LLM inference systems. The attack
framework does not directly interact with the victim's LLM and can be executed
without privilege.
  We evaluate the attack on a range of practical local LLM deployments (e.g.,
Llama, Falcon, and Gemma), and the results show that our attack achieves
promising accuracy. The restored output and input text have an average edit
distance of 5.2% and 17.3% to the ground truth, respectively. Furthermore, the
reconstructed texts achieve average cosine similarity scores of 98.7% (input)
and 98.0% (output).

TLDR: DPolicy系统通过灵活的多重差分隐私（DP）保证框架，解决了组织层面隐私风险管理的局限性，提供细粒度的隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前差分隐私（DP）在组织中的应用局限于孤立的数据发布，难以评估累积隐私风险，且传统方法无法满足复杂场景需求。

Method: 提出DPolicy系统，采用多重DP保证框架和高层次策略语言，明确隐私保证的上下文和范围。

Result: DPolicy实现了组织范围内的细粒度隐私风险管理，有效减少了隐私风险。

Conclusion: DPolicy为组织提供了全面的隐私风险管理工具，弥补了传统DP方法的不足。

Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) has emerged as a robust framework for
privacy-preserving data releases and has been successfully applied in
high-profile cases, such as the 2020 US Census. However, in organizational
settings, the use of DP remains largely confined to isolated data releases.
This approach restricts the potential of DP to serve as a framework for
comprehensive privacy risk management at an organizational level. Although one
might expect that the cumulative privacy risk of isolated releases could be
assessed using DP's compositional property, in practice, individual DP
guarantees are frequently tailored to specific releases, making it difficult to
reason about their interaction or combined impact. At the same time, less
tailored DP guarantees, which compose more easily, also offer only limited
insight because they lead to excessively large privacy budgets that convey
limited meaning. To address these limitations, we present DPolicy, a system
designed to manage cumulative privacy risks across multiple data releases using
DP. Unlike traditional approaches that treat each release in isolation or rely
on a single (global) DP guarantee, our system employs a flexible framework that
considers multiple DP guarantees simultaneously, reflecting the diverse
contexts and scopes typical of real-world DP deployments. DPolicy introduces a
high-level policy language to formalize privacy guarantees, making
traditionally implicit assumptions on scopes and contexts explicit. By deriving
the DP guarantees required to enforce complex privacy semantics from these
high-level policies, DPolicy enables fine-grained privacy risk management on an
organizational scale. We implement and evaluate DPolicy, demonstrating how it
mitigates privacy risks that can emerge without comprehensive,
organization-wide privacy risk management.

Result: 在NEORV32 SoC上验证，证明其能自动化生成结构化测试计划，提升覆盖率和实用性。

Conclusion: ThreatLens减少了人工验证工作量，提供了一种可扩展且适应性强的方法。

Abstract: Current hardware security verification processes predominantly rely on manual
threat modeling and test plan generation, which are labor-intensive,
error-prone, and struggle to scale with increasing design complexity and
evolving attack methodologies. To address these challenges, we propose
ThreatLens, an LLM-driven multi-agent framework that automates security threat
modeling and test plan generation for hardware security verification.
ThreatLens integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to extract relevant
security knowledge, LLM-powered reasoning for threat assessment, and
interactive user feedback to ensure the generation of practical test plans. By
automating these processes, the framework reduces the manual verification
effort, enhances coverage, and ensures a structured, adaptable approach to
security verification. We evaluated our framework on the NEORV32 SoC,
demonstrating its capability to automate security verification through
structured test plans and validating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Method: 通过大规模实验和人工验证评估，测试水印在随机游走攻击下的表现。

Result: 实验显示水印去除效果有限（仅26%成功，人工审查下降至10%），且质量检测器准确性不高（77%）。

Conclusion: 水印技术在实际应用中比理论模型预测的更稳健，需开发更强水印方法和更现实的攻击模型。

Abstract: Watermarking AI-generated text is critical for combating misuse. Yet recent
theoretical work argues that any watermark can be erased via random walk
attacks that perturb text while preserving quality. However, such attacks rely
on two key assumptions: (1) rapid mixing (watermarks dissolve quickly under
perturbations) and (2) reliable quality preservation (automated quality oracles
perfectly guide edits). Through large-scale experiments and human-validated
assessments, we find mixing is slow: 100% of perturbed texts retain traces of
their origin after hundreds of edits, defying rapid mixing. Oracles falter, as
state-of-the-art quality detectors misjudge edits (77% accuracy), compounding
errors during attacks. Ultimately, attacks underperform: automated walks remove
watermarks just 26% of the time -- dropping to 10% under human quality review.
These findings challenge the inevitability of watermark removal. Instead,
practical barriers -- slow mixing and imperfect quality control -- reveal
watermarking to be far more robust than theoretical models suggest. The gap
between idealized attacks and real-world feasibility underscores the need for
stronger watermarking methods and more realistic attack models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反钓鱼工具通常提供通用警告，缺乏详细解释，导致用户难以独立识别钓鱼威胁，尤其是在工具失效时。

Method: PXP 使用 LLaMA 3.2 的两步提示架构，识别钓鱼特征并生成上下文解释，同时提供标注截图。

Result: 在 7,091 个钓鱼网站测试中，PXP 成功生成 94% 的警告，准确率达 96%。用户研究显示，使用 PXP 的用户对钓鱼威胁的理解和识别能力显著提升。

Conclusion: PXP 显著提高了用户对钓鱼威胁的识别能力，尤其是对网络安全知识较少的用户，并已开源为浏览器扩展。

Abstract: Anti-phishing tools typically display generic warnings that offer users
limited explanation on why a website is considered malicious, which can prevent
end-users from developing the mental models needed to recognize phishing cues
on their own. This becomes especially problematic when these tools inevitably
fail - particularly against evasive threats, and users are found to be
ill-equipped to identify and avoid them independently. To address these
limitations, we present PhishXplain (PXP), a real-time explainable phishing
warning system designed to augment existing detection mechanisms. PXP empowers
users by clearly articulating why a site is flagged as malicious, highlighting
suspicious elements using a memory-efficient implementation of LLaMA 3.2. It
utilizes a structured two-step prompt architecture to identify phishing
features, generate contextual explanations, and render annotated screenshots
that visually reinforce the warning. Longitudinally implementing PhishXplain
over a month on 7,091 live phishing websites, we found that it can generate
warnings for 94% of the sites, with a correctness of 96%. We also evaluated
PhishXplain through a user study with 150 participants split into two groups:
one received conventional, generic warnings, while the other interacted with
PXP's explainable alerts. Participants who received the explainable warnings
not only demonstrated a significantly better understanding of phishing
indicators but also achieved higher accuracy in identifying phishing threats,
even without any warning. Moreover, they reported greater satisfaction and
trust in the warnings themselves. These improvements were especially pronounced
among users with lower initial levels of cybersecurity proficiency and
awareness. To encourage the adoption of this framework, we release PhishXplain
as an open-source browser extension.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了黑盒场景下的攻击效果和实用性，为隐私保护提供了新思路。

Abstract: In the field of digital security, Reversible Adversarial Examples (RAE)
combine adversarial attacks with reversible data hiding techniques to
effectively protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized analysis by
malicious Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, existing RAE techniques
primarily focus on white-box attacks, lacking a comprehensive evaluation of
their effectiveness in black-box scenarios. This limitation impedes their
broader deployment in complex, dynamic environments. Further more, traditional
black-box attacks are often characterized by poor transferability and high
query costs, significantly limiting their practical applicability. To address
these challenges, we propose the Dual-Phase Merging Transferable Reversible
Attack method, which generates highly transferable initial adversarial
perturbations in a white-box model and employs a memory augmented black-box
strategy to effectively mislead target mod els. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving a 99.0% attack success
rate and 100% recovery rate in black-box scenarios, highlighting its robustness
in privacy protection. Moreover, we successfully implemented a black-box attack
on a commercial model, further substantiating the potential of this approach
for practical use.

novel framework addresses four open challenges: plan correction, memory

Evaluation is performed through the automated resolution of a range of
entry-level, but not trivial, CTF challenges. The contribution of the reasoning
capability of our agentic AI framework is specifically evaluated.

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 本文首次对商业个人身份信息（PII）删除系统进行了大规模实证研究，评估其隐私保护效果。研究发现，这些服务在准确性和覆盖范围上存在显著问题，限制了其作为隐私增强技术的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业PII删除服务声称能通过自动化从数据经纪人数据库中删除PII来提升隐私，但其实际效果尚未被研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过用户研究，参与者购买四种流行PII删除服务的订阅，并报告服务发现的PII、来源数据经纪人、删除成功率及信息准确性。同时对比服务承诺与实际表现。

Result: 研究发现，这些服务仅能删除48.2%的已识别PII记录，且仅41.1%的记录确为用户PII，表明其效果有限。

Conclusion: 商业PII删除服务在隐私保护方面存在显著不足，需进一步改进以提升实用性。

Abstract: This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of commercial
personally identifiable information (PII) removal systems -- commercial
services that claim to improve privacy by automating the removal of PII from
data broker's databases. Popular examples of such services include DeleteMe,
Mozilla Monitor, Incogni, among many others. The claims these services make may
be very appealing to privacy-conscious Web users, but how effective these
services actually are at improving privacy has not been investigated. This work
aims to improve our understanding of commercial PII removal services in
multiple ways. First, we conduct a user study where participants purchase
subscriptions from four popular PII removal services, and report (i) what PII
the service find, (ii) from which data brokers, (iii) whether the service is
able to have the information removed, and (iv) whether the identified
information actually is PII describing the participant. And second, by
comparing the claims and promises the services makes (e.g. which and how many
data brokers each service claims to cover). We find that these services have
significant accuracy and coverage issues that limit the usefulness of these
services as a privacy-enhancing technology. For example, we find that the
measured services are unable to remove the majority of the identified PII

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在去中心化学习中，数据隐私保护是一个核心但尚未解决的问题。

Abstract: This paper considers random walk-based decentralized learning, where at each
iteration of the learning process, one user updates the model and sends it to a
randomly chosen neighbor until a convergence criterion is met. Preserving data
privacy is a central concern and open problem in decentralized learning. We
propose a privacy-preserving algorithm based on public-key cryptography and
anonymization. In this algorithm, the user updates the model and encrypts the
result using a distant user's public key. The encrypted result is then
transmitted through the network with the goal of reaching that specific user.
The key idea is to hide the source's identity so that, when the destination
user decrypts the result, it does not know who the source was. The challenge is
to design a network-dependent probability distribution (at the source) over the
potential destinations such that, from the receiver's perspective, all users
have a similar likelihood of being the source. We introduce the problem and
construct a scheme that provides anonymity with theoretical guarantees. We
focus on random regular graphs to establish rigorous guarantees.

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 提出了一种轻量级、单轮的安全聚合协议，适用于5G环境下的联邦学习，解决了动态性和大规模性带来的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G网络中移动设备生成敏感数据，现有安全聚合协议因多轮通信或依赖固定基础设施而不实用。

Method: 利用基站辅助计算，结合预计算、密钥同态伪随机函数和t-out-of-k秘密共享。

Result: 实验显示协议具有强安全性，通信和计算效率显著提升。

Conclusion: 该协议适合实际5G联邦学习部署。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is well-suited to 5G networks, where many mobile
devices generate sensitive edge data. Secure aggregation protocols enhance
privacy in FL by ensuring that individual user updates reveal no information
about the underlying client data. However, the dynamic and large-scale nature
of 5G-marked by high mobility and frequent dropouts-poses significant
challenges to the effective adoption of these protocols. Existing protocols
often require multi-round communication or rely on fixed infrastructure,
limiting their practicality. We propose a lightweight, single-round secure
aggregation protocol designed for 5G environments. By leveraging base stations
for assisted computation and incorporating precomputation, key-homomorphic
pseudorandom functions, and t-out-of-k secret sharing, our protocol ensures
efficiency, robustness, and privacy. Experiments show strong security
guarantees and significant gains in communication and computation efficiency,
making the approach well-suited for real-world 5G FL deployments.

Conclusion: 该协议通过消除扩散依赖和并行计算，显著提升了加密效率和实时性。

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of Shannon's confusion-diffusion architecture
in image encryption, the implementation of diffusion to sequentially establish
inter-pixel dependencies for attaining plaintext sensitivity constrains
algorithmic parallelism, while the execution of multiple rounds of diffusion
operations to meet the required sensitivity metrics incurs excessive
computational overhead. Consequently, the pursuit of plaintext sensitivity
through diffusion operations is the primary factor limiting the computational
efficiency and throughput of video encryption algorithms, rendering them
inadequate to meet the demands of real-time encryption for high-resolution
video. To address the performance limitation, this paper proposes a real-time
video encryption protocol based on heterogeneous parallel computing, which
incorporates the SHA-256 hashes of original frames as input, employs multiple
CPU threads to concurrently generate encryption-related data, and deploys
numerous GPU threads to simultaneously encrypt pixels. By leveraging the
extreme input sensitivity of the SHA hash, the proposed protocol achieves the
required plaintext sensitivity metrics with only a single round of confusion
and XOR operations, significantly reducing computational overhead. Furthermore,
through eliminating the reliance on diffusion, it realizes the allocation of a
dedicated GPU thread for encrypting each pixel within every channel,
effectively enhancing algorithm's parallelism. The experimental results
demonstrate that our approach not only exhibits superior statistical properties
and robust security but also achieving delay-free bit-level encryption for
1920$\times$1080 resolution (full high definition) video at 30 FPS, with an
average encryption time of 25.84 ms on a server equipped with an Intel Xeon
Gold 6226R CPU and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU.

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为D-STT的防御算法，通过识别和解码安全触发令牌来减少LLMs的有害输出，同时保持模型可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的安全对齐LLMs容易受到越狱攻击，导致生成有害响应，且现有防御策略效果有限。

Method: 提出D-STT算法，通过识别和解码安全触发令牌来触发模型的安全模式。

Result: 实验表明，D-STT显著降低有害输出，同时保持模型可用性和响应速度。

Conclusion: D-STT是一种简单有效的防御方法，优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively used across diverse
domains, including virtual assistants, automated code generation, and
scientific research. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks,
which manipulate the models into generating harmful responses despite safety
alignment. Recent studies have shown that current safety-aligned LLMs often
undergo the shallow safety alignment, where the first few tokens largely
determine whether the response will be harmful. Through comprehensive
observations, we find that safety-aligned LLMs and various defense strategies
generate highly similar initial tokens in their refusal responses, which we
define as safety trigger tokens. Building on this insight, we propose
\texttt{D-STT}, a simple yet effective defense algorithm that identifies and
explicitly decodes safety trigger tokens of the given safety-aligned LLM to
trigger the model's learned safety patterns. In this process, the safety
trigger is constrained to a single token, which effectively preserves model
usability by introducing minimum intervention in the decoding process.
Extensive experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks and benign prompts
demonstrate that \ours significantly reduces output harmfulness while
preserving model usability and incurring negligible response time overhead,
outperforming ten baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估联邦学习在基因组数据上的隐私风险，揭示其易受攻击的弱点。

Method: 使用合成基因组数据模拟联邦学习，测试三种攻击方式的隐私泄露情况。

Result: 梯度攻击效果最佳（精度0.79，F1分数0.87），显示隐私保护不足。

Conclusion: 需开发更强大的隐私保护机制以应对基因组数据的敏感性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising framework for collaboratively
training machine learning models across decentralized genomic datasets without
direct data sharing. While this approach preserves data locality, it remains
susceptible to sophisticated inference attacks that can compromise individual
privacy. In this study, we simulate a federated learning setup using synthetic
genomic data and assess its vulnerability to three key attack vectors:
Membership Inference Attack (MIA), Gradient-Based Membership Inference Attack,
and Label Inference Attack (LIA). Our experiments reveal that Gradient-Based
MIA achieves the highest effectiveness, with a precision of 0.79 and F1-score
of 0.87, underscoring the risk posed by gradient exposure in federated updates.
Additionally, we visualize comparative attack performance through radar plots
and quantify model leakage across clients. The findings emphasize the
inadequacy of na\"ive FL setups in safeguarding genomic privacy and motivate
the development of more robust privacy-preserving mechanisms tailored to the
unique sensitivity of genomic data.

Main category: cs.CR

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Comet的高效隐私推理系统，通过预测激活函数的稀疏分布和优化计算协议，显著提升了大型语言模型（LLM）在安全多方计算（MPC）中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着云平台上大型语言模型（LLM）推理服务的广泛使用，隐私泄露问题日益严重。MPC虽能保护隐私，但其频繁的服务器间通信导致高额性能开销。

Method: Comet利用LLM的激活稀疏性，设计了一个快速准确的预测器来预测激活函数的稀疏分布，并引入了一种新的隐私推理协议，避免零值计算。此外，通过缓存填充策略和预取机制解决了KV缓存的不连续性。

Result: 在四种常见LLM上的实验表明，Comet相比六种现有系统，实现了1.87x-2.63x的加速和1.94x-2.64x的通信减少。

Conclusion: Comet通过稀疏性预测和优化协议，显著提升了隐私推理的效率和通信性能，为LLM的隐私保护提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: With the growing use of large language models (LLMs) hosted on cloud
platforms to offer inference services, privacy concerns about the potential
leakage of sensitive information are escalating. Secure multi-party computation
(MPC) is a promising solution to protect the privacy in LLM inference. However,
MPC requires frequent inter-server communication, causing high performance
overhead.
  Inspired by the prevalent activation sparsity of LLMs, where most neuron are
not activated after non-linear activation functions, we propose an efficient
private inference system, Comet. This system employs an accurate and fast
predictor to predict the sparsity distribution of activation function output.
Additionally, we introduce a new private inference protocol. It efficiently and
securely avoids computations involving zero values by exploiting the spatial
locality of the predicted sparse distribution. While this computation-avoidance
approach impacts the spatiotemporal continuity of KV cache entries, we address
this challenge with a low-communication overhead cache refilling strategy that
merges miss requests and incorporates a prefetching mechanism. Finally, we
evaluate Comet on four common LLMs and compare it with six state-of-the-art
private inference systems. Comet achieves a 1.87x-2.63x speedup and a
1.94x-2.64x communication reduction.

Abstract: Preserving data confidentiality during the fine-tuning of open-source Large
Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for sensitive applications. This work
introduces an interactive protocol adapting the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
technique for private fine-tuning. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) protects the
confidentiality of training data and gradients handled by remote worker nodes
performing the bulk of computations involving the base model weights. The data
owner orchestrates training, requiring minimal local computing power and
memory, thus alleviating the need for expensive client-side GPUs. We
demonstrate feasibility by fine-tuning a Llama-3.2-1B model, presenting
convergence results using HE-compatible quantization and performance benchmarks
for HE computations on GPU hardware. This approach enables applications such as
confidential knowledge base question answering, private codebase fine-tuning
for AI code assistants, AI agents for drafting emails based on a company's
email archive, and adapting models to analyze sensitive legal or healthcare
documents.

Result: 提出的DRNG是首个同时满足后量子安全、标准模型安全、两轮通信生成随机值及容忍t < n/2不诚实参与者的方案。

Conclusion: 该DRNG为随机数生成提供了更安全高效的解决方案，填补了现有技术的空白。

Abstract: Randomness plays a vital role in numerous applications, including simulation,
cryptography, distributed systems, and gaming. Consequently, extensive research
has been conducted to generate randomness. One such method is to design a
decentralized random number generator (DRNG), a protocol that enables multiple
participants to collaboratively generate random outputs that must be publicly
verifiable. However, existing DRNGs are either not secure against quantum
computers or depend on the random oracle model (ROM) to achieve security. In
this paper, we design a DRNG based on lattice-based publicly verifiable secret
sharing (PVSS) that is post-quantum secure and proven secure in the standard
model. Additionally, our DRNG requires only two rounds of communication to
generate a single (pseudo)random value and can tolerate up to any t < n/2
dishonest participants. To our knowledge, the proposed DRNG construction is the
first to achieve all these properties.

Abstract: Malware, a persistent cybersecurity threat, increasingly targets
interconnected digital systems such as desktop, mobile, and IoT platforms
through sophisticated attack vectors. By exploiting these vulnerabilities,
attackers compromise the integrity and resilience of modern digital ecosystems.
To address this risk, security experts actively employ Machine Learning or Deep

inherent drawbacks and malware variants persistently evolve with increased
sophistication, necessitating advancements in detection strategies.

As a first contribution, we propose a new all-encompassing framework to study
the landscape of visualization-based malware detection techniques. Within this
framework, we systematically analyze state-of-the-art approaches across the
critical stages of the malware detection pipeline. By analyzing not only the
single techniques but also how they are combined to produce the final solution,
we shed light on the main challenges in visualization-based approaches and

Abstract: The increasing deployment of large language models in security-sensitive
domains necessitates rigorous evaluation of their resilience against
adversarial prompt-based attacks. While previous benchmarks have focused on
security evaluations with limited and predefined attack domains, such as
cybersecurity attacks, they often lack a comprehensive assessment of
intent-driven adversarial prompts and the consideration of real-life
scenario-based multi-turn attacks. To address this gap, we present
SecReEvalBench, the Security Resilience Evaluation Benchmark, which defines
four novel metrics: Prompt Attack Resilience Score, Prompt Attack Refusal Logic
Score, Chain-Based Attack Resilience Score and Chain-Based Attack Rejection
Time Score. Moreover, SecReEvalBench employs six questioning sequences for
model assessment: one-off attack, successive attack, successive reverse attack,
alternative attack, sequential ascending attack with escalating threat levels
and sequential descending attack with diminishing threat levels. In addition,
we introduce a dataset customized for the benchmark, which incorporates both
neutral and malicious prompts, categorised across seven security domains and
sixteen attack techniques. In applying this benchmark, we systematically
evaluate five state-of-the-art open-weighted large language models, Llama 3.1,
Gemma 2, Mistral v0.3, DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen 3. Our findings offer critical
insights into the strengths and weaknesses of modern large language models in
defending against evolving adversarial threats. The SecReEvalBench dataset is

Result: 恶意AP检测准确率超过95%，定位误差减少16%，执行时间降低94%。

Conclusion: 方案显著提升了定位系统的可靠性和效率，适用于长期稳定的室内定位。

Abstract: WiFi fingerprint-based indoor localization schemes deliver highly accurate
location data by matching the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) with an
offline database using machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) models.
However, over time, RSSI values degrade due to the malicious behavior of access
points (APs), causing low positional accuracy due to RSSI value mismatch with
the offline database. Existing literature lacks detection of malicious APs in
the online phase and mitigating their effects. This research addresses these
limitations and proposes a long-term reliable indoor localization scheme by
incorporating malicious AP detection and their effect mitigation techniques.
The proposed scheme uses a Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LGBM) classifier to
estimate locations and integrates simple yet efficient techniques to detect
malicious APs based on online query data. Subsequently, a mitigation technique
is incorporated that updates the offline database and online queries by
imputing stable values for malicious APs using LGBM Regressors. Additionally,
we introduce a noise addition mechanism in the offline database to capture the
dynamic environmental effects. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that the
proposed scheme attains a detection accuracy above 95% for each attack type.
The mitigation strategy effectively restores the system's performance nearly to
its original state when no malicious AP is present. The noise addition module
reduces localization errors by nearly 16%. Furthermore, the proposed solution
is lightweight, reducing the execution time by approximately 94% compared to
the existing methods.

Abstract: This paper presents a new approach of constructing $\alpha$-fractal
interpolation functions (FIFs) using neural network operators, integrating
concepts from approximation theory. Initially, we construct $\alpha$-fractals
utilizing neural network-based operators, providing an approach to generating
fractal functions with interpolation properties. Based on the same foundation,
we have developed fractal interpolation functions that utilize only the values
of the original function at the nodes or partition points, unlike traditional
methods that rely on the entire original function.
  Further, we have constructed \(\alpha\)-fractals that preserve the smoothness
of functions under certain constraints by employing a four-layered neural
network operator, ensuring that if \(f \in C^{r}[a,b]\), then the corresponding
fractal \(f^{\alpha} \in C^{r}[a,b]\). Furthermore, we analyze the convergence
of these $\alpha$-fractals to the original function under suitable conditions.
The work uses key approximation theory tools, such as the modulus of continuity
and interpolation operators, to develop convergence results and uniform
approximation error bounds.

Abstract: Attending to what is relevant is fundamental to both the mammalian brain and
modern machine learning models such as Transformers. Yet, determining relevance
remains a core challenge, traditionally offloaded to learning algorithms like
backpropagation. Inspired by recent cellular neurobiological evidence linking
neocortical pyramidal cells to distinct mental states, this work shows how
models (e.g., Transformers) can emulate high-level perceptual processing and
awake thought (imagination) states to pre-select relevant information before
applying attention. Triadic neuronal-level modulation loops among questions
($Q$), clues (keys, $K$), and hypotheses (values, $V$) enable diverse, deep,
parallel reasoning chains at the representation level and allow a rapid shift
from initial biases to refined understanding. This leads to orders-of-magnitude
faster learning with significantly reduced computational demand (e.g., fewer
heads, layers, and tokens), at an approximate cost of $\mathcal{O}(N)$, where
$N$ is the number of input tokens. Results span reinforcement learning (e.g.,
CarRacing in a high-dimensional visual setup), computer vision, and natural
language question answering.

Abstract: Given their widespread usage in the real world, the fairness of clustering
methods has become of major interest. Theoretical results on fair clustering
show that fairness enjoys transitivity: given a set of small and fair clusters,
a trivial centroid-based clustering algorithm yields a fair clustering.
Unfortunately, discovering a suitable starting clustering can be
computationally expensive, rather complex or arbitrary.
  In this paper, we propose a set of simple \emph{clusterlet}-based fuzzy
clustering algorithms that match single-class clusters, optimizing fair
clustering. Matching leverages clusterlet distance, optimizing for classic
clustering objectives, while also regularizing for fairness. Empirical results
show that simple matching strategies are able to achieve high fairness, and
that appropriate parameter tuning allows to achieve high cohesion and low
overlap.

honesty or positivity, providing a more powerful alternative to prompting or
fine-tuning. Dialz supports a diverse set of tasks, including creating
contrastive pair datasets, computing and applying steering vectors, and
visualizations. Unlike existing libraries, Dialz emphasizes modularity and
usability, enabling both rapid prototyping and in-depth analysis. We
demonstrate how Dialz can be used to reduce harmful outputs such as
stereotypes, while also providing insights into model behaviour across
different layers. We release Dialz with full documentation, tutorials, and
support for popular open-source models to encourage further research in safe
and controllable language generation. Dialz enables faster research cycles and
facilitates insights into model interpretability, paving the way for safer,
more transparent, and more reliable AI systems.

TLDR: 本文介绍了一个新的计算流体动力学数据库，用于支持机器学习在空气动力学场预测中的应用，包含468个模拟数据，并评估了多种机器学习回归器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 支持机器学习技术在空气动力学场预测中的发展，提供高质量的数据集和基准测试。

Method: 使用Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes模拟和Spalart-Allmaras湍流模型生成数据库，定义回归任务并评估多种机器学习方法。

Abstract: This paper presents a new Computational Fluid Dynamics database, developed at
ONERA, to support the advancement of machine learning techniques for
aerodynamic field prediction. It contains 468 Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes
simulations using the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model, performed on the
NASA/Boeing Common Research Model wing-body-pylon-nacelle configuration. The
database spans a wide range of flow conditions, varying Mach number (including
transonic regimes), angle of attack (capturing flow separation), and Reynolds
number (based on three stagnation pressures, with one setting matching wind
tunnel experiments). The quality of the database is assessed, through checking
the convergence level of each computation.
  Based on these data, a regression challenge is defined. It consists in
predicting the wall distributions of pressure and friction coefficients for
unseen aerodynamic conditions. The 468 simulations are split into training and
testing sets, with the training data made available publicly on the Codabench
platform. The paper further evaluates several classical machine learning
regressors on this task. Tested pointwise methods include Multi-Layer
Perceptrons, $\lambda$-DNNs, and Decision Trees, while global methods include
Multi-Layer Perceptron, k-Nearest Neighbors, Proper Orthogonal Decomposition
and IsoMap. Initial performance results, using $R^2$ scores and worst relative
mean absolute error metrics, are presented, offering insights into the
capabilities of these techniques for the challenge and references for future
work.

Motivation: 农业监测对粮食安全、可持续农业和政策制定至关重要，但传统物理模型和数据驱动模型分别存在参数不确定性和泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 提出知识引导的编码器-解码器模型，整合多个物理模型的知识，并利用语言模型处理复杂输入和模型选择。

Result: 在预测多个站点的碳和氮通量时，模型表现出高效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为农业监测提供了更通用的解决方案，能够适应不同任务和数据分布变化。

Abstract: Agricultural monitoring is critical for ensuring food security, maintaining
sustainable farming practices, informing policies on mitigating food shortage,
and managing greenhouse gas emissions. Traditional process-based physical
models are often designed and implemented for specific situations, and their
parameters could also be highly uncertain. In contrast, data-driven models
often use black-box structures and does not explicitly model the
inter-dependence between different ecological variables. As a result, they
require extensive training data and lack generalizability to different tasks
with data distribution shifts and inconsistent observed variables. To address
the need for more universal models, we propose a knowledge-guided
encoder-decoder model, which can predict key crop variables by leveraging
knowledge of underlying processes from multiple physical models. The proposed
method also integrates a language model to process complex and inconsistent
inputs and also utilizes it to implement a model selection mechanism for
selectively combining the knowledge from different physical models. Our
evaluations on predicting carbon and nitrogen fluxes for multiple sites
demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model under
various scenarios.

Motivation: 异构环境中设备的数据分布和通信能力差异显著，影响了FL的聚合效率和准确性。

Method: 提出聚类策略，利用先验知识相似性分组设备，并设计CAMU策略，以集群为基本单位调整本地更新频率。

Result: 理论验证了CAMU的收敛性，实验表明该方法在异构环境中显著提升FL性能，平衡通信与计算资源。

Conclusion: CAMU策略有效缓解了异构性带来的性能下降，优化了资源利用，提升了FL的收敛效率和准确性。

Abstract: The aggregation efficiency and accuracy of wireless Federated Learning (FL)
are significantly affected by resource constraints, especially in heterogeneous
environments where devices exhibit distinct data distributions and
communication capabilities. This paper proposes a clustering strategy that
leverages prior knowledge similarity to group devices with similar data and
communication characteristics, mitigating performance degradation from
heterogeneity. On this basis, a novel Cluster- Aware Multi-round Update (CAMU)
strategy is proposed, which treats clusters as the basic units and adjusts the
local update frequency based on the clustered contribution threshold,
effectively reducing update bias and enhancing aggregation accuracy. The
theoretical convergence of the CAMU strategy is rigorously validated.
Meanwhile, based on the convergence upper bound, the local update frequency and
transmission power of each cluster are jointly optimized to achieve an optimal
balance between computation and communication resources under constrained
conditions, significantly improving the convergence efficiency of FL.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves
the model performance of FL in heterogeneous environments and achieves a better
balance between communication cost and computational load under limited
resources.

Motivation: 开发一个完全耦合的AI气候系统模型，以解决现有模型在多圈层耦合预测中的不足。

Method: 利用AI技术构建FengShun-CSM模型，涵盖大气、海洋、陆地和海冰的相互作用，并进行60天全球预报。

Conclusion: FengShun-CSM验证了AI在气候建模中的可行性，为下一代地球系统模型提供了新范式。

Abstract: Climate system models (CSMs), through integrating cross-sphere interactions
among the atmosphere, ocean, land, and cryosphere, have emerged as pivotal
tools for deciphering climate dynamics and improving forecasting capabilities.
Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI)-driven meteorological
modeling have demonstrated remarkable success in single-sphere systems and
partially spheres coupled systems. However, the development of a fully coupled
AI-based climate system model encompassing atmosphere-ocean-land-sea ice
interactions has remained an unresolved challenge. This paper introduces
FengShun-CSM, an AI-based CSM model that provides 60-day global daily forecasts
for 29 critical variables across atmospheric, oceanic, terrestrial, and
cryospheric domains. The model significantly outperforms the European Centre
for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) model
in predicting most variables, particularly precipitation, land surface, and
oceanic components. This enhanced capability is primarily attributed to its
improved representation of intra-seasonal variability modes, most notably the
Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). Remarkably, FengShun-CSM exhibits substantial
potential in predicting subseasonal extreme events. Such breakthroughs will
advance its applications in meteorological disaster mitigation, marine
ecosystem conservation, and agricultural productivity enhancement. Furthermore,
it validates the feasibility of developing AI-powered CSMs through machine
learning technologies, establishing a transformative paradigm for
next-generation Earth system modeling.

Method: 分析KD中的蒸馏损失和下游任务损失，提出动态调整平衡参数的数学依据。

Result: 研究表明，当损失下降时，动态调整平衡参数能提升KD效果。

Conclusion: 动态调整平衡参数是优化知识蒸馏性能的有效策略。

Abstract: Although deep learning models owe their remarkable success to deep and
complex architectures, this very complexity typically comes at the expense of
real-time performance. To address this issue, a variety of model compression
techniques have been proposed, among which knowledge distillation (KD) stands
out for its strong empirical performance. The KD contains two concurrent
processes: (i) matching the outputs of a large, pre-trained teacher network and
a lightweight student network, and (ii) training the student to solve its
designated downstream task. The associated loss functions are termed the
distillation loss and the downsteam-task loss, respectively. Numerous prior
studies report that KD is most effective when the influence of the distillation
loss outweighs that of the downstream-task loss. The influence(or importance)
is typically regulated by a balancing parameter. This paper provides a
mathematical rationale showing that in a simple KD setting when the loss is
decreasing, the balancing parameter should be dynamically adjusted

Result: 实验表明，将听诊信息整合到MTL架构中，显著提升了呼吸音分类和诊断性能。

Conclusion: MTL结合元数据和深度学习，为呼吸音分析和疾病诊断提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Auscultation remains a cornerstone of clinical practice, essential for both
initial evaluation and continuous monitoring. Clinicians listen to the lung
sounds and make a diagnosis by combining the patient's medical history and test
results. Given this strong association, multitask learning (MTL) can offer a
compelling framework to simultaneously model these relationships, integrating
respiratory sound patterns with disease manifestations. While MTL has shown
considerable promise in medical applications, a significant research gap
remains in understanding the complex interplay between respiratory sounds,
disease manifestations, and patient metadata attributes. This study
investigates how integrating MTL with cutting-edge deep learning architectures
can enhance both respiratory sound classification and disease diagnosis.
Specifically, we extend recent findings regarding the beneficial impact of
metadata on respiratory sound classification by evaluating its effectiveness
within an MTL framework. Our comprehensive experiments reveal significant
improvements in both lung sound classification and diagnostic performance when
the stethoscope information is incorporated into the MTL architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练-微调范式中共享参数导致的性能下降问题，同时避免MoE方法带来的参数冗余和训练时间增加。

Method: 通过采样少量数据并利用梯度信息评估参数敏感性，自适应分配专家数量，保持与LoRA相当的内存消耗。

Result: 实验表明，LoRA-SMoE在减少可训练参数的同时提升模型性能，尤其适用于资源受限环境。

Conclusion: LoRA-SMoE是一种高效、资源友好的微调方法，适用于计算资源有限的场景。

Abstract: As deep learning models expand, the pre-training-fine-tuning paradigm has
become the standard approach for handling various downstream tasks. However,
shared parameters can lead to diminished performance when dealing with complex
datasets involving multiple tasks. While introducing Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
methods has alleviated this issue to some extent, it also significantly
increases the number of parameters required for fine-tuning and training time,
introducing greater parameter redundancy. To address these challenges, we
propose a method for allocating expert numbers based on parameter sensitivity
LoRA-SMoE (A Sensitivity-Driven Expert Allocation Method in LoRA-MoE for
Efficient Fine-Tuning). This method rapidly assesses the sensitivity of
different tasks to parameters by sampling a small amount of data and using
gradient information. It then adaptively allocates expert numbers within a
given budget. The process maintains comparable memory consumption to LoRA
(Low-Rank Adaptation) while ensuring an efficient and resource-friendly
fine-tuning procedure. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to SOTA
fine-tuning methods, our LoRA-SMoE approach can enhance model performance while
reducing the number of trainable parameters. This significantly improves model
performance in resource-constrained environments. Additionally, due to its
efficient parameter sensitivity evaluation mechanism, LoRA-SMoE requires
minimal computational overhead to optimize expert allocation, making it
particularly suitable for scenarios with limited computational resources. All
the code in this study will be made publicly available following the acceptance
of the paper for publication. Source code is at

Result: 在高维连续控制任务中，PPL显著提升了离线RLHF性能，并在在线设置中表现有效。

Conclusion: PPL通过后悔建模和KL正则化，有效解决了RLHF中的似然不匹配问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: To design rewards that align with human goals, Reinforcement Learning from
Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a prominent technique for learning reward
functions from human preferences and optimizing policies via reinforcement
learning algorithms. However, existing RLHF methods often misinterpret
trajectories as being generated by an optimal policy, causing inaccurate
likelihood estimation and suboptimal learning. Inspired by Direct Preference
Optimization framework which directly learns optimal policy without explicit
reward, we propose policy-labeled preference learning (PPL), to resolve
likelihood mismatch issues by modeling human preferences with regret, which
reflects behavior policy information. We also provide a contrastive KL
regularization, derived from regret-based principles, to enhance RLHF in
sequential decision making. Experiments in high-dimensional continuous control
tasks demonstrate PPL's significant improvements in offline RLHF performance
and its effectiveness in online settings.

Method: 提出Preference-aware ARM（PARM），使用PBLoRA技术通过偏好向量条件化ARM，实现精确的偏好权衡控制。

Result: PARM降低了推理成本，提高了与用户偏好的对齐效果，并支持弱到强指导。

Conclusion: PARM为多目标对齐提供了一种高效且资源友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-objective test-time alignment aims to adapt large language models
(LLMs) to diverse multi-dimensional user preferences during inference while
keeping LLMs frozen. Recently, GenARM (Xu et al., 2025) first independently
trains Autoregressive Reward Models (ARMs) for each preference dimension
without awareness of each other, then combines their outputs based on
user-specific preference vectors during inference to achieve multi-objective
test-time alignment, leading to two key limitations: the need for
\textit{multiple} ARMs increases the inference cost, and the separate training
of ARMs causes the misalignment between the guided generation and the user
preferences. To address these issues, we propose Preference-aware ARM (PARM), a
single unified ARM trained across all preference dimensions. PARM uses our
proposed Preference-Aware Bilinear Low-Rank Adaptation (PBLoRA), which employs
a bilinear form to condition the ARM on preference vectors, enabling it to
achieve precise control over preference trade-offs during inference.
Experiments demonstrate that PARM reduces inference costs and achieves better
alignment with preference vectors compared with existing methods. Additionally,
PARM enables weak-to-strong guidance, allowing a smaller PARM to guide a larger
frozen LLM without expensive training, making multi-objective alignment
accessible with limited computing resources. The code is available at

Conclusion: 未来可通过物理信息神经网络和光子硬件实现实时阿秒脉冲表征。

Abstract: Attosecond streaking phase retrieval is essential for resolving electron
dynamics on sub-femtosecond time scales yet traditional algorithms rely on
iterative minimization and central momentum approximations that degrade
accuracy for broadband pulses. In this work phase retrieval is reformulated as
a supervised computer-vision problem and four neural architectures are
systematically compared. A convolutional network demonstrates strong
sensitivity to local streak edges but lacks global context; a vision
transformer captures long-range delay-energy correlations at the expense of
local inductive bias; a hybrid CNN-ViT model unites local feature extraction
and full-graph attention; and a capsule network further enforces spatial pose
agreement through dynamic routing. A theoretical analysis introduces local,
global and positional sensitivity measures and derives surrogate error bounds
that predict the strict ordering $CNN<ViT<Hybrid<Capsule$. Controlled
experiments on synthetic streaking spectrograms confirm this hierarchy, with
the capsule network achieving the highest retrieval fidelity. Looking forward,
embedding the strong-field integral into physics-informed neural networks and
exploring photonic hardware implementations promise pathways toward real-time
attosecond pulse characterization under demanding experimental conditions.

Abstract: We present an interpretability framework for unsupervised reinforcement
learning (URL) agents, aimed at understanding how intrinsic motivation shapes
attention, behavior, and representation learning. We analyze five agents DQN,
RND, ICM, PPO, and a Transformer-RND variant trained on procedurally generated
environments, using Grad-CAM, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP),
exploration metrics, and latent space clustering. To capture how agents
perceive and adapt over time, we introduce two metrics: attention diversity,
which measures the spatial breadth of focus, and attention change rate, which
quantifies temporal shifts in attention. Our findings show that
curiosity-driven agents display broader, more dynamic attention and exploratory
behavior than their extrinsically motivated counterparts. Among them,
TransformerRND combines wide attention, high exploration coverage, and compact,
structured latent representations. Our results highlight the influence of
architectural inductive biases and training signals on internal agent dynamics.
Beyond reward-centric evaluation, the proposed framework offers diagnostic
tools to probe perception and abstraction in RL agents, enabling more
interpretable and generalizable behavior.

Conclusion: 研究为未来视觉基础模型在分割任务中的提示方法选择提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Prompt engineering has shown remarkable success with large language models,
yet its systematic exploration in computer vision remains limited. In semantic
segmentation, both textual and visual prompts offer distinct advantages:
textual prompts through open-vocabulary methods allow segmentation of arbitrary
categories, while visual reference prompts provide intuitive reference
examples. However, existing benchmarks evaluate these modalities in isolation,
without direct comparison under identical conditions. We present Show or Tell
(SoT), a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate both visual and
textual prompts for semantic segmentation across 14 datasets spanning 7 diverse
domains (common scenes, urban, food, waste, parts, tools, and land-cover). We
evaluate 5 open-vocabulary methods and 4 visual reference prompt approaches,
adapting the latter to handle multi-class segmentation through a
confidence-based mask merging strategy. Our extensive experiments reveal that
open-vocabulary methods excel with common concepts easily described by text but
struggle with complex domains like tools, while visual reference prompt methods
achieve good average results but exhibit high variability depending on the
input prompt. Through comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, we
identify the strengths and weaknesses of both prompting modalities, providing
valuable insights to guide future research in vision foundation models for
segmentation tasks.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of cascading risks in urban systems necessitates
robust, data-driven frameworks to model interdependencies across multiple
domains. This study presents a foundational Bayesian network-based approach for
analyzing cross-domain risk propagation across key urban domains, including
air, water, electricity, agriculture, health, infrastructure, weather, and
climate. Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are constructed using Bayesian Belief
Networks (BBNs), with structure learning guided by Hill-Climbing search
optimized through Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and K2 scoring. The
framework is trained on a hybrid dataset that combines real-world urban
indicators with synthetically generated data from Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), and is further balanced using the Synthetic Minority
Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) derived
from the learned structures enable interpretable probabilistic reasoning and
quantify the likelihood of cascading failures. The results identify key intra-
and inter-domain risk factors and demonstrate the framework's utility for
proactive urban resilience planning. This work establishes a scalable,
interpretable foundation for cascading risk assessment and serves as a basis
for future empirical research in this emerging interdisciplinary field.

Abstract: As an important graph pre-training method, Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL)
continues to play a crucial role in the ongoing surge of research on graph
foundation models or LLM as enhancer for graphs. Traditional GCL optimizes
InfoNCE by using augmentations to define self-supervised tasks, treating
augmented pairs as positive samples and others as negative. However, this leads
to semantically similar pairs being classified as negative, causing significant
sampling bias and limiting performance. In this paper, we argue that GCL is
essentially a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning problem, where the definition of
self-supervised tasks should be semantically guided, i.e., augmented samples
with similar semantics are considered positive, while others, with unknown
semantics, are treated as unlabeled. From this perspective, the key lies in how
to extract semantic information. To achieve this, we propose IFL-GCL, using
InfoNCE as a "free lunch" to extract semantic information. Specifically, We
first prove that under InfoNCE, the representation similarity of node pairs
aligns with the probability that the corresponding contrastive sample is
positive. Then we redefine the maximum likelihood objective based on the
corrected samples, leading to a new InfoNCE loss function. Extensive
experiments on both the graph pretraining framework and LLM as an enhancer show
significantly improvements of IFL-GCL in both IID and OOD scenarios, achieving
up to a 9.05% improvement, validating the effectiveness of semantically guided.

Abstract: Learning on molecule graphs has become an increasingly important topic in AI
for science, which takes full advantage of AI to facilitate scientific
discovery. Existing solutions on modeling molecules utilize Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to achieve representations but they mostly fail to adapt models
to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Although recent advances on OOD-oriented
graph learning have discovered the invariant rationale on graphs, they still
ignore three important issues, i.e., 1) the expanding atom patterns regarding
environments on graphs lead to failures of invariant rationale based models, 2)
the associations between discovered molecular subgraphs and corresponding
properties are complex where causal substructures cannot fully interpret the
labels. 3) the interactions between environments and invariances can influence
with each other thus are challenging to be modeled. To this end, we propose a
soft causal learning framework, to tackle the unresolved OOD challenge in
molecular science, from the perspective of fully modeling the molecule
environments and bypassing the invariant subgraphs. Specifically, we first
incorporate chemistry theories into our graph growth generator to imitate
expaned environments, and then devise an GIB-based objective to disentangle
environment from whole graphs and finally introduce a cross-attention based
soft causal interaction, which allows dynamic interactions between environments
and invariances. We perform experiments on seven datasets by imitating
different kinds of OOD generalization scenarios. Extensive comparison, ablation
experiments as well as visualized case studies demonstrate well generalization
ability of our proposal.

*Zhiqiang Wang,Ruoxi Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: DMRL是一种基于数据和模型感知的奖励学习方法，用于从大型语言模型中提取敏感数据，解决了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在隐私泄露风险，现有数据提取方法有局限性，如依赖重复数据、提示工程和随机搜索对抗生成。

Method: DMRL结合逆向强化学习，构建内省推理数据集并利用GRPO动态调整优化，从数据和模型层面提取敏感数据。

Result: 实验表明，DMRL在数据提取性能上优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: DMRL为LLM隐私保护提供了更高效的数据提取方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are inherently vulnerable to unintended privacy
breaches. Consequently, systematic red-teaming research is essential for
developing robust defense mechanisms. However, current data extraction methods
suffer from several limitations: (1) rely on dataset duplicates (addressable
via deduplication), (2) depend on prompt engineering (now countered by
detection and defense), and (3) rely on random-search adversarial generation.
To address these challenges, we propose DMRL, a Data- and Model-aware Reward
Learning approach for data extraction. This technique leverages inverse
reinforcement learning to extract sensitive data from LLMs. Our method consists
of two main components: (1) constructing an introspective reasoning dataset
that captures leakage mindsets to guide model behavior, and (2) training reward
models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), dynamically tuning
optimization based on task difficulty at both the data and model levels.
Comprehensive experiments across various LLMs demonstrate that DMRL outperforms
all baseline methods in data extraction performance.

TLDR: 提出了一种新的等距浸入核学习（IIKL）方法，用于构建黎曼流形并从离散非欧几里得数据中等距诱导黎曼度量，显著提升了数据表示和下游任务的准确性。

Conclusion: IIKL方法在保持数据几何结构方面优于现有方法，显著提升了数据表示和下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Geometric representation learning in preserving the intrinsic geometric and
topological properties for discrete non-Euclidean data is crucial in scientific
applications. Previous research generally mapped non-Euclidean discrete data
into Euclidean space during representation learning, which may lead to the loss
of some critical geometric information. In this paper, we propose a novel
Isometric Immersion Kernel Learning (IIKL) method to build Riemannian manifold
and isometrically induce Riemannian metric from discrete non-Euclidean data. We
prove that Isometric immersion is equivalent to the kernel function in the
tangent bundle on the manifold, which explicitly guarantees the invariance of
the inner product between vectors in the arbitrary tangent space throughout the
learning process, thus maintaining the geometric structure of the original
data. Moreover, a novel parameterized learning model based on IIKL is
introduced, and an alternating training method for this model is derived using
Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), ensuring efficient convergence.
Experimental results proved that using the learned Riemannian manifold and its
metric, our model preserved the intrinsic geometric representation of data in
both 3D and high-dimensional datasets successfully, and significantly improved
the accuracy of downstream tasks, such as data reconstruction and
classification. It is showed that our method could reduce the inner product
invariant loss by more than 90% compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods,
also achieved an average 40% improvement in downstream reconstruction accuracy
and a 90% reduction in error for geometric metrics involving isometric and
conformal.

Conclusion: 通过理论和实践结合，该研究为NILM的全球能源可持续发展应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The growing global energy demand and the urgent need for sustainability call
for innovative ways to boost energy efficiency. While advanced energy-saving
systems exist, they often fall short without user engagement. Providing
feedback on energy consumption behavior is key to promoting sustainable
practices. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a promising solution by
disaggregating total household energy usage, recorded by a central smart meter,
into appliance-level data. This empowers users to optimize consumption.
Advances in AI, IoT, and smart meter adoption have further enhanced NILM's
potential.
  Despite this promise, real-world NILM deployment faces major challenges.
First, existing datasets mainly represent regions like the USA and UK, leaving
places like the Mediterranean underrepresented. This limits understanding of
regional consumption patterns, such as heavy use of air conditioners and
electric water heaters. Second, deep learning models used in NILM require high
computational power, often relying on cloud services. This increases costs,
raises privacy concerns, and limits scalability, especially for households with
poor connectivity. This thesis tackles these issues with key contributions. It
presents an interoperable data collection framework and introduces the Plegma
Dataset, focused on underrepresented Mediterranean energy patterns. It also
explores advanced deep neural networks and model compression techniques for
efficient edge deployment. By bridging theoretical advances with practical
needs, this work aims to make NILM scalable, efficient, and adaptable for
global energy sustainability.

Result: 在10个组合优化问题上验证了UniCO的泛化能力，能够以少量或零样本适应新问题。

Conclusion: UniCO为专注于单个问题的神经组合优化方法提供了有价值的补充。

Abstract: Combinatorial Optimization (CO) encompasses a wide range of problems that
arise in many real-world scenarios. While significant progress has been made in
developing learning-based methods for specialized CO problems, a unified model
with a single architecture and parameter set for diverse CO problems remains
elusive. Such a model would offer substantial advantages in terms of efficiency
and convenience. In this paper, we introduce UniCO, a unified model for solving
various CO problems. Inspired by the success of next-token prediction, we frame
each problem-solving process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), tokenize the
corresponding sequential trajectory data, and train the model using a
transformer backbone. To reduce token length in the trajectory data, we propose
a CO-prefix design that aggregates static problem features. To address the
heterogeneity of state and action tokens within the MDP, we employ a two-stage
self-supervised learning approach. In this approach, a dynamic prediction model
is first trained and then serves as a pre-trained model for subsequent policy
generation. Experiments across 10 CO problems showcase the versatility of
UniCO, emphasizing its ability to generalize to new, unseen problems with
minimal fine-tuning, achieving even few-shot or zero-shot performance. Our
framework offers a valuable complement to existing neural CO methods that focus
on optimizing performance for individual problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市交通流量数据对规划至关重要，但传感器部署成本高且稀疏，现有方法难以适应城市网络的多样性和零膨胀分布。

Method: GNNUI采用掩码算法学习插值，整合节点特征捕捉功能角色，并使用针对零膨胀分布的损失函数。

Result: GNNUI在MAE、RMSE等指标上优于现有方法，且在传感器覆盖率极低（1%）时仍表现稳健。

Conclusion: GNNUI为城市交通流量估计提供了高效解决方案，尤其在数据稀缺情况下表现突出。

Abstract: Reliable street-level traffic volume data, covering multiple modes of
transportation, helps urban planning by informing decisions on infrastructure
improvements, traffic management, and public transportation. Yet, traffic
sensors measuring traffic volume are typically scarcely located, due to their
high deployment and maintenance costs. To address this, interpolation methods
can estimate traffic volumes at unobserved locations using available data.
Graph Neural Networks have shown strong performance in traffic volume
forecasting, particularly on highways and major arterial networks. Applying
them to urban settings, however, presents unique challenges: urban networks
exhibit greater structural diversity, traffic volumes are highly overdispersed
with many zeros, the best way to account for spatial dependencies remains
unclear, and sensor coverage is often very sparse. We introduce the Graph
Neural Network for Urban Interpolation (GNNUI), a novel urban traffic volume
estimation approach. GNNUI employs a masking algorithm to learn interpolation,
integrates node features to capture functional roles, and uses a loss function
tailored to zero-inflated traffic distributions. In addition to the model, we
introduce two new open, large-scale urban traffic volume benchmarks, covering
different transportation modes: Strava cycling data from Berlin and New York
City taxi data. GNNUI outperforms recent, some graph-based, interpolation
methods across metrics (MAE, RMSE, true-zero rate, Kullback-Leibler divergence)
and remains robust from 90% to 1% sensor coverage. On Strava, for instance, MAE
rises only from 7.1 to 10.5, on Taxi from 23.0 to 40.4, demonstrating strong
performance under extreme data scarcity, common in real-world urban settings.
We also examine how graph connectivity choices influence model accuracy.

Result: LLM压缩率超过20倍，显著优于Gzip的3倍，且在不同模型和数据集上表现稳健。

Conclusion: LLM作为自身输出的压缩器具有高效性和实用性，适用于生成式AI场景。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to be deployed and utilized across
domains, the volume of LLM-generated data is growing rapidly. This trend
highlights the increasing importance of effective and lossless compression for
such data in modern text management systems. However, compressing LLM-generated
data presents unique challenges compared to traditional human- or
machine-generated content. Traditional machine-generated data is typically
derived from computational processes or device outputs, often highly structured
and limited to low-level elements like labels or numerical values. This
structure enables conventional lossless compressors to perform efficiently. In
contrast, LLM-generated data is more complex and diverse, requiring new
approaches for effective compression. In this work, we conduct the first
systematic investigation of lossless compression techniques tailored
specifically to LLM-generated data. Notably, because LLMs are trained via
next-token prediction, we find that LLM-generated data is highly predictable
for the models themselves. This predictability enables LLMs to serve as
efficient compressors of their own outputs. Through extensive experiments with
14 representative LLMs and 8 LLM-generated datasets from diverse domains, we
show that LLM-based prediction methods achieve remarkable compression rates,
exceeding 20x, far surpassing the 3x rate achieved by Gzip, a widely used
general-purpose compressor. Furthermore, this advantage holds across different
LLM sizes and dataset types, demonstrating the robustness and practicality of
LLM-based methods in lossless text compression under generative AI workloads.

user-specific variability through Variational Edge Feature Extractor. A
Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL) enforces adversarial domain generalization,
ensuring robustness to unseen users. Extensive experiments on OPPORTUNITY and

Abstract: Computation-intensive tensor operators constitute over 90\% of the
computations in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Deep Neural
Networks.Automatically and efficiently generating high-performance tensor
operators with hardware primitives is crucial for diverse and ever-evolving
hardware architectures like RISC-V, ARM, and GPUs, as manually optimized
implementation takes at least months and lacks portability.LLMs excel at
generating high-level language codes, but they struggle to fully comprehend
hardware characteristics and produce high-performance tensor operators. We
introduce a tensor-operator auto-generation framework with a one-line user
prompt (QiMeng-TensorOp), which enables LLMs to automatically exploit hardware
characteristics to generate tensor operators with hardware primitives, and tune
parameters for optimal performance across diverse hardware. Experimental
results on various hardware platforms, SOTA LLMs, and typical tensor operators
demonstrate that QiMeng-TensorOp effectively unleashes the computing capability
of various hardware platforms, and automatically generates tensor operators of
superior performance. Compared with vanilla LLMs, QiMeng-TensorOp achieves up

Abstract: Multimodal Information Extraction (MIE) has gained attention for extracting
structured information from multimedia sources. Traditional methods tackle MIE
tasks separately, missing opportunities to share knowledge across tasks. Recent
approaches unify these tasks into a generation problem using instruction-based
T5 models with visual adaptors, optimized through full-parameter fine-tuning.
However, this method is computationally intensive, and multi-task fine-tuning
often faces gradient conflicts, limiting performance. To address these
challenges, we propose collaborative multi-LoRA experts with achievement-based
multi-task loss (C-LoRAE) for MIE tasks. C-LoRAE extends the low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) method by incorporating a universal expert to learn shared
multimodal knowledge from cross-MIE tasks and task-specific experts to learn
specialized instructional task features. This configuration enhances the
model's generalization ability across multiple tasks while maintaining the
independence of various instruction tasks and mitigating gradient conflicts.
Additionally, we propose an achievement-based multi-task loss to balance
training progress across tasks, addressing the imbalance caused by varying
numbers of training samples in MIE tasks. Experimental results on seven
benchmark datasets across three key MIE tasks demonstrate that C-LoRAE achieves
superior overall performance compared to traditional fine-tuning methods and
LoRA methods while utilizing a comparable number of training parameters to
LoRA.

Abstract: The generation of voluminous scientific data poses significant challenges for
efficient storage, transfer, and analysis. Recently, error-bounded lossy
compression methods emerged due to their ability to achieve high compression
ratios while controlling data distortion. However, they often overlook the
inherent spatial and temporal correlations within scientific data, thus missing
opportunities for higher compression. In this paper we propose GRAPHCOMP, a
novel graph-based method for error-bounded lossy compression of scientific
data. We perform irregular segmentation of the original grid data and generate
a graph representation that preserves the spatial and temporal correlations.
Inspired by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we then propose a temporal graph
autoencoder to learn latent representations that significantly reduce the size
of the graph, effectively compressing the original data. Decompression reverses
the process and utilizes the learnt graph model together with the latent
representation to reconstruct an approximation of the original data. The
decompressed data are guaranteed to satisfy a user-defined point-wise error
bound. We compare our method against the state-of-the-art error-bounded lossy
methods (i.e., HPEZ, SZ3.1, SPERR, and ZFP) on large-scale real and synthetic
data. GRAPHCOMP consistently achieves the highest compression ratio across most
datasets, outperforming the second-best method by margins ranging from 22% to
50%.

Conclusion: 强化学习能有效解决GRAG问题，尤其在复杂图结构中表现优异。

Abstract: Game-theoretic resource allocation on graphs (GRAG) involves two players
competing over multiple steps to control nodes of interest on a graph, a
problem modeled as a multi-step Colonel Blotto Game (MCBG). Finding optimal
strategies is challenging due to the dynamic action space and structural
constraints imposed by the graph. To address this, we formulate the MCBG as a
Markov Decision Process (MDP) and apply Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods,
specifically Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). To
enforce graph constraints, we introduce an action-displacement adjacency matrix
that dynamically generates valid action sets at each step. We evaluate RL
performance across a variety of graph structures and initial resource
distributions, comparing against random, greedy, and learned RL policies.
Experimental results show that both DQN and PPO consistently outperform
baseline strategies and converge to a balanced $50\%$ win rate when competing
against the learned RL policy. Particularly, on asymmetric graphs, RL agents
successfully exploit structural advantages and adapt their allocation
strategies, even under disadvantageous initial resource distributions.

Result: MLP在多个数据集（Amazon、Twitter、SST）上优于基线，成本仅为微调基线的1/100。

Conclusion: 新方法有效提升多情感冲突段落的情感分类性能，且经济高效。

Abstract: Sentiment classification, a complex task in natural language processing,
becomes even more challenging when analyzing passages with multiple conflicting
tones. Typically, longer passages exacerbate this issue, leading to decreased
model performance. The aim of this paper is to introduce novel methodologies
for isolating conflicting sentiments and aggregating them to effectively
predict the overall sentiment of such passages. One of the aggregation
strategies involves a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model which outperforms
baseline models across various datasets, including Amazon, Twitter, and SST
while costing $\sim$1/100 of what fine-tuning the baseline would take.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains. However, they still face significant challenges, including high
computational costs for training and limitations in solving complex reasoning
problems. Although existing methods have extended the reasoning capabilities of
LLMs through structured paradigms, these approaches often rely on task-specific
prompts and predefined reasoning processes, which constrain their flexibility
and generalizability. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
framework that leverages graph learning to enable more flexible and adaptive
reasoning capabilities for LLMs. Specifically, this approach models the
reasoning process of a problem as a graph and employs LLM-based graph learning
to guide the adaptive generation of each reasoning step. To further enhance the
adaptability of the model, we introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN) module to
perform representation learning on the generated reasoning process, enabling
real-time adjustments to both the model and the prompt. Experimental results
demonstrate that this method significantly improves reasoning performance
across multiple tasks without requiring additional training or task-specific
prompt design. Code can be found in https://github.com/zch65458525/L2T.

Result: 用户研究表明，人类干预提升模型性能，但也可能引入偏见。

Conclusion: HILL提出了一种新的人机交互范式，探索人类直觉对模型训练的影响及其潜在风险。

Abstract: Latent space representations are critical for understanding and improving the
behavior of machine learning models, yet they often remain obscure and
intricate. Understanding and exploring the latent space has the potential to
contribute valuable human intuition and expertise about respective domains. In
this work, we present HILL, an interactive framework allowing users to
incorporate human intuition into the model training by interactively reshaping
latent space representations. The modifications are infused into the model
training loop via a novel approach inspired by knowledge distillation, treating
the user's modifications as a teacher to guide the model in reshaping its
intrinsic latent representation. The process allows the model to converge more
effectively and overcome inefficiencies, as well as provide beneficial insights
to the user. We evaluated HILL in a user study tasking participants to train an
optimal model, closely observing the employed strategies. The results
demonstrated that human-guided latent space modifications enhance model
performance while maintaining generalization, yet also revealing the risks of
including user biases. Our work introduces a novel human-AI interaction
paradigm that infuses human intuition into model training and critically
examines the impact of human intervention on training strategies and potential
biases.

Conclusion: LLMs能减少数据需求、提升适应性，并为NILM应用提供透明的能源分解。

Abstract: Non-intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) aims to disaggregate aggregate household
electricity consumption into individual appliance usage, enabling more
effective energy management. While deep learning has advanced NILM, it remains
limited by its dependence on labeled data, restricted generalization, and lack
of interpretability. In this paper, we introduce the first prompt-based NILM
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) with in-context learning.
We design and evaluate prompt strategies that integrate appliance features,
timestamps and contextual information, as well as representative time-series
examples, using the REDD dataset. With optimized prompts, LLMs achieve
competitive state detection accuracy, reaching an average F1-score of 0.676 on
unseen households, and demonstrate robust generalization without the need for
fine-tuning. LLMs also enhance interpretability by providing clear,
human-readable explanations for their predictions. Our results show that LLMs
can reduce data requirements, improve adaptability, and provide transparent
energy disaggregation in NILM applications.

TLDR: Mask-PINNs通过引入可学习的非线性掩码函数，解决了PINNs中的内部协变量偏移问题，显著提升了特征分布稳定性、精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs在解决偏微分方程时，内部协变量偏移问题阻碍了神经网络容量的有效利用，传统归一化方法如BatchNorm或LayerNorm可能违反物理规律。

Method: 提出Mask-PINNs架构，引入可学习的非线性掩码函数，在不违反物理规律的前提下约束特征分布。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提升了特征分布稳定性、精度和鲁棒性，并支持更宽网络的稳定高效训练。

Conclusion: Mask-PINNs为PINNs中的内部协变量偏移问题提供了有效解决方案，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a class of deep learning models
designed to solve partial differential equations by incorporating physical laws
directly into the loss function. However, the internal covariate shift, which
has been largely overlooked, hinders the effective utilization of neural
network capacity in PINNs. To this end, we propose Mask-PINNs, a novel
architecture designed to address this issue in PINNs. Unlike traditional
normalization methods such as BatchNorm or LayerNorm, we introduce a learnable,
nonlinear mask function that constrains the feature distributions without
violating underlying physics. The experimental results show that the proposed
method significantly improves feature distribution stability, accuracy, and
robustness across various activation functions and PDE benchmarks. Furthermore,
it enables the stable and efficient training of wider networks a capability
that has been largely overlooked in PINNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索FL服务器端的安全漏洞，尤其是通过客户端攻击引发服务器内存的Rowhammer攻击，填补了现有研究中对服务器端攻击的不足。

Method: 方法包括利用强化学习（RL）攻击者操纵客户端传感器观察，最大化服务器重复内存更新频率，从而远程触发Rowhammer攻击。

Result: 实验表明，攻击者能在目标服务器模型中实现约70%的重复更新率（RUR），成功诱导服务器DRAM的位翻转。

Conclusion: 结论指出这种攻击可能导致学习中断或权限提升，呼吁进一步研究FL和硬件设计的实际缓解策略。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has the potential for simultaneous global learning
amongst a large number of parallel agents, enabling emerging AI such as LLMs to
be trained across demographically diverse data. Central to this being efficient
is the ability for FL to perform sparse gradient updates and remote direct
memory access at the central server. Most of the research in FL security
focuses on protecting data privacy at the edge client or in the communication
channels between the client and server. Client-facing attacks on the server are
less well investigated as the assumption is that a large collective of clients
offer resilience.
  Here, we show that by attacking certain clients that lead to a high frequency
repetitive memory update in the server, we can remote initiate a rowhammer
attack on the server memory. For the first time, we do not need backdoor access
to the server, and a reinforcement learning (RL) attacker can learn how to
maximize server repetitive memory updates by manipulating the client's sensor
observation. The consequence of the remote rowhammer attack is that we are able
to achieve bit flips, which can corrupt the server memory. We demonstrate the
feasibility of our attack using a large-scale FL automatic speech recognition
(ASR) systems with sparse updates, our adversarial attacking agent can achieve
around 70\% repeated update rate (RUR) in the targeted server model,
effectively inducing bit flips on server DRAM. The security implications are
that can cause disruptions to learning or may inadvertently cause elevated
privilege. This paves the way for further research on practical mitigation
strategies in FL and hardware design.

Abstract: In modern assembly pipelines, identifying anomalies is crucial in ensuring
product quality and operational efficiency. Conventional single-modality
methods fail to capture the intricate relationships required for precise
anomaly prediction in complex predictive environments with abundant data and
multiple modalities. This paper proposes a neurosymbolic AI and fusion-based
approach for multimodal anomaly prediction in assembly pipelines. We introduce
a time series and image-based fusion model that leverages decision-level fusion
techniques. Our research builds upon three primary novel approaches in
multimodal learning: time series and image-based decision-level fusion
modeling, transfer learning for fusion, and knowledge-infused learning. We
evaluate the novel method using our derived and publicly available multimodal
dataset and conduct comprehensive ablation studies to assess the impact of our
preprocessing techniques and fusion model compared to traditional baselines.
The results demonstrate that a neurosymbolic AI-based fusion approach that uses
transfer learning can effectively harness the complementary strengths of time
series and image data, offering a robust and interpretable approach for anomaly
prediction in assembly pipelines with enhanced performance. \noindent The

Abstract: In academic settings, the demanding environment often forces students to
prioritize academic performance over their physical well-being. Moreover,
privacy concerns and the inherent risk of data breaches hinder the deployment
of traditional machine learning techniques for addressing these health
challenges. In this study, we introduce RiM: Record, Improve, and Maintain, a
mobile application which incorporates a novel personalized machine learning
framework that leverages federated learning to enhance students' physical
well-being by analyzing their lifestyle habits. Our approach involves
pre-training a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model on a large-scale simulated
dataset to generate personalized recommendations. Subsequently, we employ
federated learning to fine-tune the model using data from IISER Bhopal
students, thereby ensuring its applicability in real-world scenarios. The
federated learning approach guarantees differential privacy by exclusively
sharing model weights rather than raw data. Experimental results show that the
FedAvg-based RiM model achieves an average accuracy of 60.71% and a mean
absolute error of 0.91--outperforming the FedPer variant (average accuracy
46.34%, MAE 1.19)--thereby demonstrating its efficacy in predicting lifestyle
deficits under privacy-preserving constraints.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that sponge attacks can significantly increase the
energy consumption and inference latency of deep neural networks (DNNs).
However, prior work has focused primarily on computer vision and natural
language processing tasks, overlooking the growing use of lightweight AI models
in sensing-based applications on resource-constrained devices, such as those in
Internet of Things (IoT) environments. These attacks pose serious threats of
energy depletion and latency degradation in systems where limited battery
capacity and real-time responsiveness are critical for reliable operation. This
paper makes two key contributions. First, we present the first systematic
exploration of energy-latency sponge attacks targeting sensing-based AI models.
Using wearable sensing-based AI as a case study, we demonstrate that sponge
attacks can substantially degrade performance by increasing energy consumption,
leading to faster battery drain, and by prolonging inference latency. Second,
to mitigate such attacks, we investigate model pruning, a widely adopted
compression technique for resource-constrained AI, as a potential defense. Our
experiments show that pruning-induced sparsity significantly improves model
resilience against sponge poisoning. We also quantify the trade-offs between
model efficiency and attack resilience, offering insights into the security
implications of model compression in sensing-based AI systems deployed in IoT
environments.

Conclusion: 该方法为数据遗忘提供了一种新颖、高效且可验证的解决方案。

Abstract: It is often desirable to remove (a.k.a. unlearn) a speciffc part of the
training data from a trained neural network model. A typical application
scenario is to protect the data holder's right to be forgotten, which has been
promoted by many recent regulation rules. Existing unlearning methods involve
training alternative models with remaining data, which may be costly and
challenging to verify from the data holder or a thirdparty auditor's
perspective. In this work, we provide a new angle and propose a novel
unlearning approach by imposing carefully crafted "patch" on the original
neural network to achieve targeted "forgetting" of the requested data to
delete. Speciffcally, inspired by the research line of neural network repair,
we propose to strategically seek a lightweight minimum "patch" for unlearning a
given data point with certiffable guarantee. Furthermore, to unlearn a
considerable amount of data points (or an entire class), we propose to
iteratively select a small subset of representative data points to unlearn,
which achieves the effect of unlearning the whole set. Extensive experiments on
multiple categorical datasets demonstrates our approach's effectiveness,
achieving measurable unlearning while preserving the model's performance and
being competitive in efffciency and memory consumption compared to various
baseline methods.

Conclusion: CAST为个性化医疗提供了更精确的工具，适用于HNSCC等严重疾病。

Abstract: Causal machine learning (CML) enables individualized estimation of treatment
effects, offering critical advantages over traditional correlation-based
methods. However, existing approaches for medical survival data with censoring
such as causal survival forests estimate effects at fixed time points, limiting
their ability to capture dynamic changes over time. We introduce Causal
Analysis for Survival Trajectories (CAST), a novel framework that models
treatment effects as continuous functions of time following treatment. By
combining parametric and non-parametric methods, CAST overcomes the limitations
of discrete time-point analysis to estimate continuous effect trajectories.
Using the RADCURE dataset [1] of 2,651 patients with head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as a clinically relevant example, CAST models how
chemotherapy and radiotherapy effects evolve over time at the population and
individual levels. By capturing the temporal dynamics of treatment response,
CAST reveals how treatment effects rise, peak, and decline over the follow-up
period, helping clinicians determine when and for whom treatment benefits are
maximized. This framework advances the application of CML to personalized care
in HNSCC and other life-threatening medical conditions. Source code/data

served as a valuable resource for those hoping to understand and optimize the
energy consumption of their generative AI services. In this paper, we explain
four key design principles for benchmarking ML energy we have acquired over
time, and then describe how they are implemented in the ML.ENERGY Benchmark. We
then highlight results from the latest iteration of the benchmark, including
energy measurements of 40 widely used model architectures across 6 different
tasks, case studies of how ML design choices impact energy consumption, and how
automated optimization recommendations can lead to significant (sometimes more
than 40%) energy savings without changing what is being computed by the model.

Conclusion: PBACC是一种高效且通用的隐私保护方法，适用于多种联邦学习场景，计算成本仅与数据分散程度相关。

Abstract: Coded computing is one of the techniques that can be used for privacy
protection in Federated Learning. However, most of the constructions used for
coded computing work only under the assumption that the computations involved
are exact, generally restricted to special classes of functions, and require
quantized inputs. This paper considers the use of Private Berrut Approximate
Coded Computing (PBACC) as a general solution to add strong but non-perfect
privacy to federated learning. We derive new adapted PBACC algorithms for
centralized aggregation, secure distributed training with centralized data, and
secure decentralized training with decentralized data, thus enlarging
significantly the applications of the method and the existing privacy
protection tools available for these paradigms. Particularly, PBACC can be used
robustly to attain privacy guarantees in decentralized federated learning for a
variety of models. Our numerical results show that the achievable quality of
different learning models (convolutional neural networks, variational
autoencoders, and Cox regression) is minimally altered by using these new
computing schemes, and that the privacy leakage can be bounded strictly to less
than a fraction of one bit per participant. Additionally, the computational
cost of the encoding and decoding processes depends only of the degree of
decentralization of the data.

Result: 显著提升了用户观看时间和收入，证明了Tweedie回归的优越性。

Conclusion: Tweedie损失函数是一种高效解决方案，适用于以单一目标为导向的推荐系统设计。

Abstract: Modern recommendation systems aim to increase click-through rates (CTR) for
better user experience, through commonly treating ranking as a classification
task focused on predicting CTR. However, there is a gap between this method and
the actual objectives of businesses across different sectors. In video
recommendation services, the objective of video on demand (VOD) extends beyond
merely encouraging clicks, but also guiding users to discover their true
interests, leading to increased watch time. And longer users watch time will
leads to more revenue through increased chances of presenting online display
advertisements. This research addresses the issue by redefining the problem
from classification to regression, with a focus on maximizing revenue through
user viewing time. Due to the lack of positive labels on recommendation, the
study introduces Tweedie Loss Function, which is better suited in this scenario
than the traditional mean square error loss. The paper also provides insights
on how Tweedie process capture users diverse interests. Our offline simulation
and online A/B test revealed that we can substantially enhance our core
business objectives: user engagement in terms of viewing time and,
consequently, revenue. Additionally, we provide a theoretical comparison
between the Tweedie Loss and the commonly employed viewing time weighted
Logloss, highlighting why Tweedie Regression stands out as an efficient
solution. We further outline a framework for designing a loss function that
focuses on a singular objective.

Finocchiaro et al. (2024), we find the target loss for which the Lov\'asz hinge
is consistent. This target, which we call the structured abstain problem, is a
variant of selective classification for structured prediction that allows one
to abstain on any subset of the k binary predictions. We derive a family of
link functions, each of which is simultaneously consistent for all
polymatroids, a subset of submodular set functions. We then give sufficient
conditions on the polymatroid for the structured abstain problem to be tightly
embedded by the Lov\'asz hinge, meaning no target prediction is redundant. We
experimentally demonstrate the potential of the structured abstain problem for
interpretability in structured classification tasks. Finally, for the
multiclass setting, we show that one can combine the binary encoding
construction of Ramaswamy et al. (2018) with our link construction to achieve
an efficient consistent surrogate for a natural multiclass generalization of
the structured abstain problem.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been widely used to obtain
solutions to various physical phenomena modeled as Differential Equations. As
PINNs are not naturally equipped with mechanisms for Uncertainty
Quantification, some work has been done to quantify the different uncertainties
that arise when dealing with PINNs. In this paper, we use a two-step procedure
to train Bayesian Neural Networks that provide uncertainties over the solutions
to differential equation systems provided by PINNs. We use available error
bounds over PINNs to formulate a heteroscedastic variance that improves the
uncertainty estimation. Furthermore, we solve forward problems and utilize the
obtained uncertainties when doing parameter estimation in inverse problems in
cosmology.

TLDR: 论文通过实验框架研究了上下文学习（ICL），比较了不同任务复杂度和模型架构对性能的影响，发现模型架构对ICL表现有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同模型架构在复杂任务中的上下文学习能力，以优化模型选择和设计。

Method: 使用四种模型（标准Transformer、FlashAttention Transformer、Hyena卷积模型和Mamba状态空间模型）在合成数据集上进行训练和测试。

Result: 标准Transformer表现稳健，Mamba擅长时间结构任务，Hyena能捕捉长程依赖但训练初期方差较大，FlashAttention计算高效但对低数据敏感。

Conclusion: 模型架构对ICL性能至关重要，不同架构在不同任务中各有优势，需根据任务特点选择合适模型。

Abstract: We investigate in-context learning (ICL) through a meticulous experimental
framework that systematically varies task complexity and model architecture.
Extending beyond the linear regression baseline, we introduce Gaussian kernel
regression and nonlinear dynamical system tasks, which emphasize temporal and
recursive reasoning. We evaluate four distinct models: a GPT2-style
Transformer, a Transformer with FlashAttention mechanism, a convolutional
Hyena-based model, and the Mamba state-space model. Each model is trained from
scratch on synthetic datasets and assessed for generalization during testing.
Our findings highlight that model architecture significantly shapes ICL
performance. The standard Transformer demonstrates robust performance across
diverse tasks, while Mamba excels in temporally structured dynamics. Hyena
effectively captures long-range dependencies but shows higher variance early in
training, and FlashAttention offers computational efficiency but is more
sensitive in low-data regimes. Further analysis uncovers locality-induced
shortcuts in Gaussian kernel tasks, enhanced nonlinear separability through
input range scaling, and the critical role of curriculum learning in mastering
high-dimensional tasks.

Abstract: The deployment of mixture-of-experts (MoE) large language models (LLMs)
presents significant challenges due to their high memory demands. These
challenges become even more pronounced in multi-tenant environments, where
shared resources must accommodate multiple models, limiting the effectiveness
of conventional virtualization techniques. This paper addresses the problem of
efficiently serving multiple fine-tuned MoE-LLMs on a single-GPU. We propose a
serving system that employs \textit{similarity-based expert consolidation} to
reduce the overall memory footprint by sharing similar experts across models.
To ensure output quality, we introduce \textit{runtime partial
reconfiguration}, dynamically replacing non-expert layers when processing
requests from different models. As a result, our approach achieves a
competitive output quality while maintaining throughput comparable to serving a
single model while incurring a negligible increase in time-to-first-token
(TTFT). Experiments on a server with a single NVIDIA A100 GPU (80GB) using
Mixtral-8x7B models demonstrate an 85\% average reduction in turnaround time
compared to NVIDIA's multi-instance GPU (MIG). Furthermore, experiments on
Google's Switch Transformer Base-8 model with up to four variants demonstrate
the scalability and resilience of our approach in maintaining output quality
compared to other model merging baselines, highlighting its effectiveness.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy optimization in static

to the lack of environmental interaction. In this paper, we present
Video-Enhanced Offline RL (VeoRL), a model-based approach that constructs an

Abstract: Traditional Federated Learning (FL) faces significant challenges in terms of

clients employ diverse model architectures and have varying computational

performance bottlenecks and reduced model generalizability. To address these
issues, we propose FedADP, a federated learning framework designed to adapt to
client heterogeneity by dynamically adjusting model architectures during
aggregation. FedADP enables effective collaboration among clients with
differing capabilities, maximizing resource utilization and ensuring model

Conclusion: SHAP与贝叶斯优化的结合为材料设计提供了高效且经济的解决方案，并可推广至其他工程问题。

Abstract: We developed an interpretability informed Bayesian optimization framework to
optimize underwater acoustic coatings based on polyurethane elastomers with
embedded metamaterial features. A data driven model was employed to analyze the
relationship between acoustic performance, specifically sound absorption and
the corresponding design variables. By leveraging SHapley Additive exPlanations
(SHAP), a machine learning interpretability tool, we identified the key
parameters influencing the objective function and gained insights into how
these parameters affect sound absorption. The insights derived from the SHAP
analysis were subsequently used to automatically refine the bounds of the
optimization problem automatically, enabling a more targeted and efficient
exploration of the design space.
  The proposed approach was applied to two polyurethane materials with distinct
hardness levels, resulting in improved optimal solutions compared to those
obtained without SHAP-informed guidance. Notably, these enhancements were
achieved without increasing the number of simulation iterations. Our findings
demonstrate the potential of SHAP to streamline optimization processes by
uncovering hidden parameter relationships and guiding the search toward
promising regions of the design space. This work underscores the effectiveness
of combining interpretability techniques with Bayesian optimization for the
efficient and cost-effective design of underwater acoustic metamaterials under
strict computational constraints and can be generalized towards other materials
and engineering optimization problems.

Method: GBDTSVM模型通过GBDT提取特征，SVM进行分类，并结合高斯核相似性提高预测准确性。

Result: 模型在多个数据集上表现优异，AUROC达0.96，AUPRC达0.95，并通过案例研究验证了预测结果。

Conclusion: GBDTSVM是一种高效的工具，有助于推动snoRNA相关疾病研究。

Abstract: Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are increasingly recognized for their critical
role in the pathogenesis and characterization of various human diseases.
Consequently, the precise identification of snoRNA-disease associations (SDAs)
is essential for the progression of diseases and the advancement of treatment
strategies. However, conventional biological experimental approaches are
costly, time-consuming, and resource-intensive; therefore, machine
learning-based computational methods offer a promising solution to mitigate
these limitations. This paper proposes a model called 'GBDTSVM', representing a
novel and efficient machine learning approach for predicting snoRNA-disease
associations by leveraging a Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and Support
Vector Machine (SVM). 'GBDTSVM' effectively extracts integrated snoRNA-disease
feature representations utilizing GBDT and SVM is subsequently utilized to
classify and identify potential associations. Furthermore, the method enhances
the accuracy of these predictions by incorporating Gaussian kernel profile
similarity for both snoRNAs and diseases. Experimental evaluation of the
GBDTSVM model demonstrated superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
methods in the field, achieving an area under the receiver operating
characteristic (AUROC) of 0.96 and an area under the precision-recall curve
(AUPRC) of 0.95 on MDRF dataset. Moreover, our model shows superior performance
on two more datasets named LSGT and PsnoD. Additionally, a case study on the
predicted snoRNA-disease associations verified the top 10 predicted snoRNAs
across nine prevalent diseases, further validating the efficacy of the GBDTSVM
approach. These results underscore the model's potential as a robust tool for
advancing snoRNA-related disease research. Source codes and datasets our
proposed framework can be obtained from: https://github.com/mariamuna04/gbdtsvm

Result: dcFCI在合成和真实数据中表现优异，能恢复真实PAG并提供结构不确定性分析。

Conclusion: dcFCI为因果推理提供了更稳健和可靠的工具。

Abstract: Causal discovery is central to inferring causal relationships from
observational data. In the presence of latent confounding, algorithms such as
Fast Causal Inference (FCI) learn a Partial Ancestral Graph (PAG) representing
the true model's Markov Equivalence Class. However, their correctness
critically depends on empirical faithfulness, the assumption that observed
(in)dependencies perfectly reflect those of the underlying causal model, which
often fails in practice due to limited sample sizes. To address this, we
introduce the first nonparametric score to assess a PAG's compatibility with
observed data, even with mixed variable types. This score is both necessary and
sufficient to characterize structural uncertainty and distinguish between
distinct PAGs. We then propose data-compatible FCI (dcFCI), the first hybrid
causal discovery algorithm to jointly address latent confounding, empirical
unfaithfulness, and mixed data types. dcFCI integrates our score into an
(Anytime)FCI-guided search that systematically explores, ranks, and validates
candidate PAGs. Experiments on synthetic and real-world scenarios demonstrate
that dcFCI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, often recovering
the true PAG even in small and heterogeneous datasets. Examining top-ranked
PAGs further provides valuable insights into structural uncertainty, supporting
more robust and informed causal reasoning and decision-making.

Conclusion: 成对自编码器框架及其变体为逆问题提供了高效解决方案，同时支持不确定性分析。

Abstract: In this book chapter, we discuss recent advances in data-driven approaches
for inverse problems. In particular, we focus on the \emph{paired autoencoder}
framework, which has proven to be a powerful tool for solving inverse problems
in scientific computing. The paired autoencoder framework is a novel approach
that leverages the strengths of both data-driven and model-based methods by
projecting both the data and the quantity of interest into a latent space and
mapping these latent spaces to provide surrogate forward and inverse mappings.
We illustrate the advantages of this approach through numerical experiments,
including seismic imaging and classical inpainting: nonlinear and linear
inverse problems, respectively. Although the paired autoencoder framework is
likelihood-free, it generates multiple data- and model-based reconstruction
metrics that help assess whether examples are in or out of distribution. In
addition to direct model estimates from data, the paired autoencoder enables
latent-space refinement to fit the observed data accurately. Numerical
experiments show that this procedure, combined with the latent-space initial
guess, is essential for high-quality estimates, even when data noise exceeds
the training regime. We also introduce two novel variants that combine
variational and paired autoencoder ideas, maintaining the original benefits
while enabling sampling for uncertainty analysis.

Conclusion: 该框架为神经网络的正则化策略和结构优化提供了新视角，并为探索网络内在结构开辟了新途径。

Abstract: When neural networks (NNs) are subject to L2 regularization, increasing the
regularization strength beyond a certain threshold pushes the model into an
under-parameterization regime. This transition manifests as a first-order phase
transition in single-hidden-layer NNs and a second-order phase transition in
NNs with two or more hidden layers. This paper establishes a unified framework
for such transitions by integrating the Ricci curvature of the loss landscape
with regularizer-driven deep learning. First, we show that a curvature
change-point separates the model-accuracy regimes in the onset of learning and
that it is identical to the critical point of the phase transition driven by
regularization. Second, we show that for more complex data sets additional
phase transitions exist between model accuracies, and that they are again
identical to curvature change points in the error landscape. Third, by studying
the MNIST data set using a Variational Autoencoder, we demonstrate that the
curvature change points identify phase transitions in model accuracy outside
the L2 setting. Our framework also offers practical insights for optimizing
model performance across various architectures and datasets. By linking
geometric features of the error landscape to observable phase transitions, our
work paves the way for more informed regularization strategies and potentially
new methods for probing the intrinsic structure of neural networks beyond the
L2 context.

Result: 首次将少样本室内场景分类任务应用于CSAI，模型在真实数据集上表现良好，且未直接训练敏感数据。

Conclusion: 代理任务和LEAs反馈的结合为CSAI自动化检测提供了可行且安全的解决方案。

Abstract: The distribution of child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI) is an ever-growing
concern of our modern world; children who suffered from this heinous crime are
revictimized, and the growing amount of illegal imagery distributed overwhelms
law enforcement agents (LEAs) with the manual labor of categorization. To ease
this burden researchers have explored methods for automating data triage and
detection of CSAI, but the sensitive nature of the data imposes restricted
access and minimal interaction between real data and learning algorithms,
avoiding leaks at all costs. In observing how these restrictions have shaped
the literature we formalize a definition of "Proxy Tasks", i.e., the substitute
tasks used for training models for CSAI without making use of CSA data. Under
this new terminology we review current literature and present a protocol for
making conscious use of Proxy Tasks together with consistent input from LEAs to
design better automation in this field. Finally, we apply this protocol to
study -- for the first time -- the task of Few-shot Indoor Scene Classification
on CSAI, showing a final model that achieves promising results on a real-world
CSAI dataset whilst having no weights actually trained on sensitive data.

Conclusion: Dyn-D$^2$P首次实现了动态梯度裁剪和噪声水平的差分隐私去中心化非凸优化模型效用分析。

Abstract: Most existing decentralized learning methods with differential privacy (DP)
guarantee rely on constant gradient clipping bounds and fixed-level DP Gaussian
noises for each node throughout the training process, leading to a significant
accuracy degradation compared to non-private counterparts. In this paper, we
propose a new Dynamic Differentially Private Decentralized learning approach
(termed Dyn-D$^2$P) tailored for general time-varying directed networks.
Leveraging the Gaussian DP (GDP) framework for privacy accounting, Dyn-D$^2$P
dynamically adjusts gradient clipping bounds and noise levels based on gradient
convergence. This proposed dynamic noise strategy enables us to enhance model
accuracy while preserving the total privacy budget. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of Dyn-D$^2$P over its
counterparts employing fixed-level noises, especially under strong privacy
guarantees. Furthermore, we provide a provable utility bound for Dyn-D$^2$P
that establishes an explicit dependency on network-related parameters, with a
scaling factor of $1/\sqrt{n}$ in terms of the number of nodes $n$ up to a bias
error term induced by gradient clipping. To our knowledge, this is the first
model utility analysis for differentially private decentralized non-convex
optimization with dynamic gradient clipping bounds and noise levels.

Result: BOF4-S结合OPQ在4-bit块级量化技术中表现最优，显著降低了困惑度。

Conclusion: 优化块级量化方法和混合精度策略能有效减少量化误差，提升LLMs的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demand extensive memory capacity during both
fine-tuning and inference. To enable memory-efficient fine-tuning, existing
methods apply block-wise quantization techniques, such as NF4 and AF4, to the
network weights. We show that these quantization techniques incur suboptimal
quantization errors. Therefore, as a first novelty, we propose an optimization
approach for block-wise quantization. Using this method, we design a family of
quantizers named 4-bit block-wise optimal float (BOF4), which consistently
reduces the quantization error compared to both baseline methods. We provide
both a theoretical and a data-driven solution for the optimization process and
prove their practical equivalence. Secondly, we propose a modification to the
employed normalization method based on the signed absolute block maximum
(BOF4-S), enabling further reduction of the quantization error and empirically
achieving less degradation in language modeling performance. Thirdly, we
explore additional variations of block-wise quantization methods applied to
LLMs through an experimental study on the importance of accurately representing
zero and large-amplitude weights on the one hand, and optimization towards
various error metrics on the other hand. Lastly, we introduce a mixed-precision
quantization strategy dubbed outlier-preserving quantization (OPQ) to address
the distributional mismatch induced by outlier weights in block-wise
quantization. By storing outlier weights in 16-bit precision (OPQ) while
applying BOF4-S, we achieve top performance among 4-bit block-wise quantization
techniques w.r.t. perplexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波浪高度（Hs）的非线性和非平稳特性使其预测具有挑战性，现有方法在分解预处理时可能导致数据泄漏。

Method: AFE-TFNet采用编码器-解码器滚动框架，结合小波变换和傅里叶变换提取全局和局部频域特征，并通过主导谐波序列能量加权（DHSEW）融合时域和频域特征。解码器使用LSTM模型。

Result: AFE-TFNet在预测准确性上显著优于基准方法，特征提取显著提高了预测精度，DHSEW大幅提升了中长期预测准确性。

Conclusion: AFE-TFNet在处理复杂信号预测方面表现出强大潜力。

Abstract: Precise forecasting of significant wave height (Hs) is essential for the
development and utilization of wave energy. The challenges in predicting Hs
arise from its non-linear and non-stationary characteristics. The combination
of decomposition preprocessing and machine learning models have demonstrated
significant effectiveness in Hs prediction by extracting data features.
However, decomposing the unknown data in the test set can lead to data leakage
issues. To simultaneously achieve data feature extraction and prevent data
leakage, a novel Adaptive Feature Extraction Time-Frequency Network (AFE-TFNet)
is proposed to improve prediction accuracy and stability. It is encoder-decoder
rolling framework. The encoder consists of two stages: feature extraction and
feature fusion. In the feature extraction stage, global and local frequency
domain features are extracted by combining Wavelet Transform (WT) and Fourier
Transform (FT), and multi-scale frequency analysis is performed using Inception
blocks. In the feature fusion stage, time-domain and frequency-domain features
are integrated through dominant harmonic sequence energy weighting (DHSEW). The
decoder employed an advanced long short-term memory (LSTM) model. Hourly
measured wind speed (Ws), dominant wave period (DPD), average wave period (APD)
and Hs from three stations are used as the dataset, and the four metrics are
employed to evaluate the forecasting performance. Results show that AFE-TFNet
significantly outperforms benchmark methods in terms of prediction accuracy.
Feature extraction can significantly improve the prediction accuracy. DHSEW has
substantially increased the accuracy of medium-term to long-term forecasting.
The prediction accuracy of AFE-TFNet does not demonstrate significant
variability with changes of rolling time window size. Overall, AFE-TFNet shows
strong potential for handling complex signal forecasting.

Conclusion: E2E-FANet能够准确预测浮动防波堤后的波浪，并在多样化波浪条件下表现出优异的性能。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of waves behind floating breakwaters (FB) is crucial for
optimizing coastal engineering structures, enhancing safety, and improving
design efficiency. Existing methods demonstrate limitations in capturing
nonlinear interactions between waves and structures, while exhibiting
insufficient capability in modeling the complex frequency-domain relationships
among elevations of different wave gauges. To address these challenges, this
study introduces the Exogenous-to-Endogenous Frequency-Aware Network
(E2E-FANet), a novel end-to-end neural network designed to model relationships
between waves and structures. The E2E-FANetarchitecture incorporates a
Dual-Basis Frequency Mapping (DBFM) module that leverages orthogonal cosine and
sine bases to extract wave features from the frequency domain while preserving
temporal information. Additionally, we introduce the Exogenous-to-Endogenous
Cross-Attention (E2ECA) module, which employs cross attention to model the
interactions between endogenous and exogenous variables. We incorporate a
Temporal-wise Attention (TA) mechanism that adaptively captures complex
dependencies in endogenous variables. These integrated modules function
synergistically, enabling E2E-FANet to achieve both comprehensive feature
perception in the time-frequency domain and precise modeling of wave-structure
interactions. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of E2E-FANet, we
constructed a multi-level validation framework comprising three distinct
testing scenarios: internal validation under identical wave conditions,
generalization testing across different wave conditions, and adaptability
testing with varying relative water density (RW) conditions. These
comprehensive tests demonstrate that E2E-FANet provides accurate waves behind
FB predictions while successfully generalizing diverse wave conditions.

Result: 实验验证了理论分析，DRRho-CLIP在性能和数据效率上优于无参考模型的方法。

Conclusion: DRRho框架为模型引导提供了理论基础，并在实践中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: This paper formalizes an emerging learning paradigm that uses a trained model
as a reference to guide and enhance the training of a target model through
strategic data selection or weighting, named $\textbf{model steering}$. While
ad-hoc methods have been used in various contexts, including the training of
large foundation models, its underlying principles remain insufficiently
understood, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this work, we propose a
theory-driven framework for model steering called $\textbf{DRRho risk
minimization}$, which is rooted in Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO).
Through a generalization analysis, we provide theoretical insights into why
this approach improves generalization and data efficiency compared to training
without a reference model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time
such theoretical insights are provided for the new learning paradigm, which
significantly enhance our understanding and practice of model steering.
Building on these insights and the connection between contrastive learning and
DRO, we introduce a novel method for Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining
(CLIP) with a reference model, termed DRRho-CLIP. Extensive experiments
validate the theoretical insights, reveal a superior scaling law compared to
CLIP without a reference model, and demonstrate its strength over existing
heuristic approaches.

### [107] [Beyond $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ Constraint Violation for Online Convex Optimization with Adversarial Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06709)
*Abhishek Sinha,Rahul Vaze*

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: N/A


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We revisit the Online Convex Optimization problem with adversarial
constraints (COCO) where, in each round, a learner is presented with a convex
cost function and a convex constraint function, both of which may be chosen
adversarially. The learner selects actions from a convex decision set in an
online fashion, with the goal of minimizing both regret and the cumulative
constraint violation (CCV) over a horizon of $T$ rounds. The best-known policy
for this problem achieves $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ CCV.
In this paper, we present a surprising improvement that achieves a
significantly smaller CCV by trading it off with regret. Specifically, for any
bounded convex cost and constraint functions, we propose an online policy that
achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{dT}+ T^\beta)$ regret and $\tilde{O}(dT^{1-\beta})$
CCV, where $d$ is the dimension of the decision set and $\beta \in [0,1]$ is a
tunable parameter. We achieve this result by first considering the special case
of $\textsf{Constrained Expert}$ problem where the decision set is a
probability simplex and the cost and constraint functions are linear.
Leveraging a new adaptive small-loss regret bound, we propose an efficient
policy for the $\textsf{Constrained Expert}$ problem, that attains
$O(\sqrt{T\ln N}+T^{\beta})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\beta} \ln N)$ CCV,
where $N$ is the number of experts. The original problem is then reduced to the
$\textsf{Constrained Expert}$ problem via a covering argument. Finally, with an
additional smoothness assumption, we propose an efficient gradient-based policy
attaining $O(T^{\max(\frac{1}{2},\beta)})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\beta})$
CCV.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种轻量级LSTM模型，用于同时分类活动和执行者，并处理传感器数据缺失问题。在UCI HAR数据集上，活动识别准确率达93.89%，执行者识别达80.19%。KNN填补法在无PCA时表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HAR研究多关注活动分类，忽视执行者识别和数据缺失问题，而这两者对个性化应用至关重要。

Method: 采用轻量级LSTM模型，结合KNN填补法处理缺失数据，对比了有无PCA的效果。

Result: 活动识别准确率93.89%，执行者识别80.19%；KNN填补法在无PCA时表现最优。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了数据缺失问题，为HAR研究提供了新基准。

Abstract: Current studies in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) primarily focus on the
classification of activities through sensor data, while there is not much
emphasis placed on recognizing the individuals performing these activities.
This type of classification is very important for developing personalized and
context-sensitive applications. Additionally, the issue of missing sensor data,
which often occurs in practical situations due to hardware malfunctions, has
not been explored yet. This paper seeks to fill these voids by introducing a
lightweight LSTM-based model that can be used to classify both activities and
subjects. The proposed model was used to classify the HAR dataset by UCI [1],
achieving an accuracy of 93.89% in activity recognition (across six
activities), nearing the 96.67% benchmark, and an accuracy of 80.19% in subject
recognition (involving 30 subjects), thereby establishing a new baseline for
this area of research. We then simulate the absence of sensor data to mirror
real-world scenarios and incorporate imputation techniques, both with and
without Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to restore incomplete datasets. We
found that K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation performs the best for filling
the missing sensor data without PCA because the use of PCA resulted in slightly
lower accuracy. These results demonstrate how well the framework handles
missing sensor data, which is a major step forward in using the Human Activity
Recognition dataset for reliable classification tasks.

Result: DxANN能够同时提供准确预测和透明决策，适用于图像任务，并可扩展到其他数据类型。

Conclusion: DxANN为深度学习提供了内在可解释性，适用于需要信任和问责的应用场景。

Abstract: While deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable success in numerous
domains, their black-box nature remains a significant limitation, especially in
critical fields such as medical image analysis and inference. Existing
explainability methods, such as SHAP, LIME, and Grad-CAM, are typically applied
post hoc, adding computational overhead and sometimes producing inconsistent or
ambiguous results. In this paper, we present the Deeply Explainable Artificial
Neural Network (DxANN), a novel deep learning architecture that embeds
explainability ante hoc, directly into the training process. Unlike
conventional models that require external interpretation methods, DxANN is
designed to produce per-sample, per-feature explanations as part of the forward
pass. Built on a flow-based framework, it enables both accurate predictions and
transparent decision-making, and is particularly well-suited for image-based
tasks. While our focus is on medical imaging, the DxANN architecture is readily
adaptable to other data modalities, including tabular and sequential data.
DxANN marks a step forward toward intrinsically interpretable deep learning,
offering a practical solution for applications where trust and accountability
are essential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生产线的主动控制机制设计复杂，缺乏标准化框架，RL虽有潜力但尚未成熟。

Method: 开发了LineFlow框架，模拟生产线并训练RL代理，通过数学分析和最优解验证其能力。

Result: RL在简单场景中接近最优性能，但在复杂工业场景中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究奖励设计、课程学习和分层控制以提升RL在复杂生产线的表现。

Abstract: Many production lines require active control mechanisms, such as adaptive
routing, worker reallocation, and rescheduling, to maintain optimal
performance. However, designing these control systems is challenging for
various reasons, and while reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in
addressing these challenges, a standardized and general framework is still
lacking. In this work, we introduce LineFlow, an extensible, open-source Python
framework for simulating production lines of arbitrary complexity and training
RL agents to control them. To demonstrate the capabilities and to validate the
underlying theoretical assumptions of LineFlow, we formulate core subproblems
of active line control in ways that facilitate mathematical analysis. For each
problem, we provide optimal solutions for comparison. We benchmark
state-of-the-art RL algorithms and show that the learned policies approach
optimal performance in well-understood scenarios. However, for more complex,
industrial-scale production lines, RL still faces significant challenges,
highlighting the need for further research in areas such as reward shaping,
curriculum learning, and hierarchical control.

Conclusion: 玻尔兹曼分类器展示了物理原理如何指导机器学习新方向，为基于能量的可解释决策系统奠定基础。

Abstract: We propose a novel classification algorithm, the Boltzmann Classifier,
inspired by the thermodynamic principles underlying the Boltzmann distribution.
Our method computes a probabilistic estimate for each class based on an energy
function derived from feature-wise deviations between input samples and
class-specific centroids. The resulting probabilities are proportional to the
exponential negative energies, normalized across classes, analogous to the
Boltzmann distribution used in statistical mechanics. In addition, the KT
variable can be used to allow the high energy states to be more accessible,
which allows the tuning of their probabilities as needed. We evaluate the model
performance on several datasets from different applications. The model achieves
a high accuracy, which indicates that the Boltzmann Classifier is competitive
with standard models like logistic regression and k-nearest neighbors while
offering a thermodynamically motivated probabilistic interpretation. our
classifier does not require iterative optimization or backpropagation and is
thus computationally efficient and easy to integrate into existing workflows.
This work demonstrates how ideas from physics can inform new directions in
machine learning, providing a foundation for interpretable, energy-based
decision-making systems.

Motivation: 揭示微调阶段LLMs的安全漏洞，并开发一种更有效的攻击方法，以评估现有防御策略的不足。

Method: 从异常检测角度出发，提出Self-Inf-N方法，识别并提取良性数据集中对安全性影响最大的样本进行微调。

Result: 在七种主流LLMs上的实验表明，仅用100个异常样本微调即可严重破坏模型的安全性，且攻击具有高迁移性。

Conclusion: 现有防御策略难以应对此类攻击，亟需更鲁棒的安全对齐方法。

Abstract: Recent studies have uncovered a troubling vulnerability in the fine-tuning
stage of large language models (LLMs): even fine-tuning on entirely benign
datasets can lead to a significant increase in the harmfulness of LLM outputs.
Building on this finding, our red teaming study takes this threat one step
further by developing a more effective attack. Specifically, we analyze and
identify samples within benign datasets that contribute most to safety
degradation, then fine-tune LLMs exclusively on these samples. We approach this
problem from an outlier detection perspective and propose Self-Inf-N, to detect
and extract outliers for fine-tuning. Our findings reveal that fine-tuning LLMs
on 100 outlier samples selected by Self-Inf-N in the benign datasets severely
compromises LLM safety alignment. Extensive experiments across seven mainstream
LLMs demonstrate that our attack exhibits high transferability across different
architectures and remains effective in practical scenarios. Alarmingly, our
results indicate that most existing mitigation strategies fail to defend
against this attack, underscoring the urgent need for more robust alignment
safeguards. Codes are available at

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have significantly advanced text-to-image
synthesis, demonstrating impressive text comprehension and zero-shot
generalization. These models refine images from random noise based on textual
prompts, with initial reliance on text input shifting towards enhanced visual
fidelity over time. This transition suggests that static model parameters might
not optimally address the distinct phases of generation. We introduce LGR-AD
(Learning Graph Representation of Agent Diffusers), a novel multi-agent system
designed to improve adaptability in dynamic computer vision tasks. LGR-AD
models the generation process as a distributed system of interacting agents,
each representing an expert sub-model. These agents dynamically adapt to
varying conditions and collaborate through a graph neural network that encodes
their relationships and performance metrics. Our approach employs a
coordination mechanism based on top-$k$ maximum spanning trees, optimizing the
generation process. Each agent's decision-making is guided by a meta-model that
minimizes a novel loss function, balancing accuracy and diversity. Theoretical
analysis and extensive empirical evaluations show that LGR-AD outperforms
traditional diffusion models across various benchmarks, highlighting its
potential for scalable and flexible solutions in complex image generation
tasks. Code is available at: https://github.com/YousIA/LGR_AD

Abstract: This paper quantitatively investigates the crash severity of Autonomous
Vehicles (AVs) with spatially localized machine learning and macroscopic
measures of the urban built environment. We address spatial heterogeneity and
spatial autocorrelation, while focusing on land use patterns and human
behavior. Our Geographical Random Forest (GRF) model, accompanied with a crash
severity risk map of San Francisco, presents three findings that are useful for
commercial operations of AVs and robotaxis. First, spatially localized machine
learning performed better than regular machine learning, when predicting AV
crash severity. Bias-variance tradeoff was evident as we adjust the
localization weight hyperparameter. Second, land use was the most important
built environment measure, compared to intersections, building footprints,
public transit stops, and Points Of Interests (POIs). Third, it was predicted
that city center areas with greater diversity and commercial activities were
more likely to result in low-severity AV crashes, than residential
neighborhoods. Residential land use may be associated with higher severity due
to human behavior and less restrictive environment. This paper recommends to
explicitly consider geographic locations, and to design safety measures
specific to residential neighborhoods, when robotaxi operators train their AV
systems.

Abstract: Commodity price volatility creates economic challenges, necessitating
accurate multi-horizon forecasting. Predicting prices for commodities like
copper and crude oil is complicated by diverse interacting factors
(macroeconomic, supply/demand, geopolitical, etc.). Current models often lack
transparency, limiting strategic use. This paper presents a Regularized Sparse
Autoencoder (RSAE), a deep learning framework for simultaneous multi-horizon
commodity price prediction and discovery of interpretable latent market
drivers. The RSAE forecasts prices at multiple horizons (e.g., 1-day, 1-week,
1-month) using multivariate time series. Crucially, L1 regularization
($\|\mathbf{z}\|_1$) on its latent vector $\mathbf{z}$ enforces sparsity,
promoting parsimonious explanations of market dynamics through learned factors
representing underlying drivers (e.g., demand, supply shocks). Drawing from
energy-based models and sparse coding, the RSAE optimizes predictive accuracy
while learning sparse representations. Evaluated on historical Copper and Crude
Oil data with numerous indicators, our findings indicate the RSAE offers
competitive multi-horizon forecasting accuracy and data-driven insights into
price dynamics via its interpretable latent space, a key advantage over
traditional black-box approaches.

Conclusion: 非泛化交互的学习是训练与测试损失差距的直接原因。

Abstract: This paper proposes a new perspective for analyzing the generalization power
of deep neural networks (DNNs), i.e., directly disentangling and analyzing the
dynamics of generalizable and non-generalizable interaction encoded by a DNN
through the training process. Specifically, this work builds upon the recent
theoretical achievement in explainble AI, which proves that the detailed
inference logic of DNNs can be can be strictly rewritten as a small number of
AND-OR interaction patterns. Based on this, we propose an efficient method to
quantify the generalization power of each interaction, and we discover a
distinct three-phase dynamics of the generalization power of interactions
during training. In particular, the early phase of training typically removes
noisy and non-generalizable interactions and learns simple and generalizable
ones. The second and the third phases tend to capture increasingly complex
interactions that are harder to generalize. Experimental results verify that
the learning of non-generalizable interactions is the the direct cause for the
gap between the training and testing losses.

Abstract: For domains that involve numerical simulation, it can be computationally
expensive to run an ensemble of simulations spanning a parameter space of
interest to a user. To this end, an attractive surrogate for simulation is the
generative modeling of fields produced by an ensemble, allowing one to
synthesize fields in a computationally cheap, yet accurate, manner. However,
for the purposes of visual analysis, a limitation of generative models is their
lack of control, as it is unclear what one should expect when sampling a field
from a model. In this paper we study how to make generative models of fields
more controllable, so that users can specify features of interest, in
particular topological features, that they wish to see in the output. We
propose topology guidance, a method for guiding the sampling process of a
generative model, specifically a diffusion model, such that a topological
description specified as input is satisfied in the generated output. Central to
our method, we couple a coordinate-based neural network used to represent
fields, with a diffusion model used for generation. We show how to use
topologically-relevant signals provided by the coordinate-based network to help
guide the denoising process of a diffusion model. This enables us to faithfully
represent a user's specified topology, while ensuring that the output field
remains within the generative data distribution. Specifically, we study 2D
vector field topology, evaluating our method over an ensemble of fluid flows,
where we show that generated vector fields faithfully adhere to the location,
and type, of critical points over the spatial domain. We further show the
benefits of our method in aiding the comparison of ensembles, allowing one to
explore commonalities and differences in distributions along prescribed
topological features.

Abstract: Illegal parking along with the lack of available parking spaces are among the
biggest issues faced in many large cities. These issues can have a significant
impact on the quality of life of citizens. On-street parking systems have been
designed to this end aiming at ensuring that parking spaces will be available
for the local population, while also providing easy access to parking for
people visiting the city center. However, these systems are often affected by
illegal parking, providing incorrect information regarding the availability of
parking spaces. Even though this can be mitigated using sensors for detecting
the presence of cars in various parking sectors, the cost of these
implementations is usually prohibiting large. In this paper, we investigate an
indirect way of predicting parking violations at a fine-grained level,
equipping such parking systems with a valuable tool for providing more accurate
information to citizens. To this end, we employed a Deep Learning (DL)-based
model to predict fine-grained parking violation rates for on-street parking
systems. Moreover, we developed a data augmentation and smoothing technique for
further improving the accuracy of DL models under the presence of missing and
noisy data. We demonstrate, using experiments on real data collected in
Thessaloniki, Greece, that the developed system can indeed provide accurate
parking violation predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升切片Wasserstein距离的计算可扩展性，特别是在处理样本流时。

Method: 通过流式计算一维Wasserstein距离（1DW），并利用分位数近似技术定义流式1DW距离，进而扩展到所有投影以定义Stream-SW。

Result: Stream-SW在内存消耗更低的情况下，比随机子采样更准确地近似SW，并在多个实验中表现优越。

Conclusion: Stream-SW是一种高效且理论可靠的方法，适用于从样本流中计算SW。

Abstract: Sliced optimal transport (SOT) or sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance is widely
recognized for its statistical and computational scalability. In this work, we
further enhance the computational scalability by proposing the first method for
computing SW from sample streams, called \emph{streaming sliced Wasserstein}
(Stream-SW). To define Stream-SW, we first introduce the streaming computation
of the one-dimensional Wasserstein distance. Since the one-dimensional
Wasserstein (1DW) distance has a closed-form expression, given by the absolute
difference between the quantile functions of the compared distributions, we
leverage quantile approximation techniques for sample streams to define the
streaming 1DW distance. By applying streaming 1DW to all projections, we obtain
Stream-SW. The key advantage of Stream-SW is its low memory complexity while
providing theoretical guarantees on the approximation error. We demonstrate
that Stream-SW achieves a more accurate approximation of SW than random
subsampling, with lower memory consumption, in comparing Gaussian distributions
and mixtures of Gaussians from streaming samples. Additionally, we conduct
experiments on point cloud classification, point cloud gradient flows, and
streaming change point detection to further highlight the favorable performance
of Stream-SW.

Result: 理论证明高粒度能带来指数级表达能力提升，实验结果支持这一结论。

Conclusion: 高粒度的MoE设计能显著提升模型性能，建议采用更多活跃专家。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers are increasingly central to frontier model
architectures. By selectively activating parameters, they reduce computational
cost while scaling total parameter count. This paper investigates the impact of
the number of active experts, termed granularity, comparing architectures with
many (e.g., 8 per layer in DeepSeek) to those with fewer (e.g., 1 per layer in
Llama-4 models). We prove an exponential separation in network expressivity
based on this design parameter, suggesting that models benefit from higher
granularity. Experimental results corroborate our theoretical findings and
illustrate this separation.

Abstract: Digital twins enable real-time simulation and prediction in engineering
systems. This paper presents a novel framework for predictive digital twins of
a headlamp heatsink, integrating physics-based reduced-order models (ROMs) from

Conclusion: 通过平滑机制考虑树分裂位置的不确定性，改进模型综合了两种方法的优势，表现更优。

Abstract: Gaussian process regression is a popular model in the small data regime due
to its sound uncertainty quantification and the exploitation of the smoothness
of the regression function that is encountered in a wide range of practical
problems. However, Gaussian processes perform sub-optimally when the degree of
smoothness is non-homogeneous across the input domain. Random forest regression
partially addresses this issue by providing local basis functions of variable
support set sizes that are chosen in a data-driven way. However, they do so at
the expense of forgoing any degree of smoothness, which often results in poor
performance in the small data regime. Here, we aim to combine the advantages of
both models by applying a kernel-based smoothing mechanism to a learned random
forest or any other piecewise constant prediction function. As we demonstrate
empirically, the resulting model consistently improves the predictive
performance of the underlying random forests and, in almost all test cases,
also improves the log loss of the usual uncertainty quantification based on
inter-tree variance. The latter advantage can be attributed to the ability of
the smoothing model to take into account the uncertainty over the exact
tree-splitting locations.

TLDR: FreqMoE通过低频预训练和高频微调，解决了FNO在高频信号稀疏性上的问题，显著提升了计算效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频信号稀疏性和固定模式截断导致FNO在高维输入或长期预测中性能下降。

Method: 提出FreqMoE框架，先学习低频权重，再通过稀疏上循环策略构建频域专家混合模型。

Result: 在规则和不规则网格PDE上，FreqMoE精度提升16.6%，参数减少47.32倍，且长期预测稳定。

Conclusion: FreqMoE为PDE求解建立了新的低频预训练-高频微调范式，适用于多种FNO变体和网格结构。

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) have emerged as promising solutions for
efficiently solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by learning
infinite-dimensional function mappings through frequency domain
transformations. However, the sparsity of high-frequency signals limits
computational efficiency for high-dimensional inputs, and fixed-pattern
truncation often causes high-frequency signal loss, reducing performance in
scenarios such as high-resolution inputs or long-term predictions. To address
these challenges, we propose FreqMoE, an efficient and progressive training
framework that exploits the dependency of high-frequency signals on
low-frequency components. The model first learns low-frequency weights and then
applies a sparse upward-cycling strategy to construct a mixture of experts
(MoE) in the frequency domain, effectively extending the learned weights to
high-frequency regions. Experiments on both regular and irregular grid PDEs
demonstrate that FreqMoE achieves up to 16.6% accuracy improvement while using
merely 2.1% parameters (47.32x reduction) compared to dense FNO. Furthermore,
the approach demonstrates remarkable stability in long-term predictions and
generalizes seamlessly to various FNO variants and grid structures,
establishing a new ``Low frequency Pretraining, High frequency Fine-tuning''
paradigm for solving PDEs.

Motivation: 现有方法假设特定偏好模型（如Bradley-Terry模型），导致统计不一致，无法保证收敛到真实人类偏好。

Method: 引入Direct Density Ratio Optimization (DDRO)，直接估计偏好与非偏好输出的密度比。

Result: DDRO在多个主要基准测试中表现优于现有方法，且理论上具有统计一致性。

Conclusion: DDRO为真正数据驱动的对齐方法铺平了道路，有望实现更可靠且与人类偏好一致的LLMs。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial for
safe deployment, yet existing methods assume specific preference models like
Bradley-Terry model. This assumption leads to statistical inconsistency, where
more data doesn't guarantee convergence to true human preferences. To address
this critical gap, we introduce a novel alignment method Direct Density Ratio
Optimization (DDRO). DDRO directly estimates the density ratio between
preferred and unpreferred output distributions, circumventing the need for
explicit human preference modeling. We theoretically prove that DDRO is
statistically consistent, ensuring convergence to the true preferred
distribution as the data size grows, regardless of the underlying preference
structure. Experiments demonstrate that DDRO achieves superior performance
compared to existing methods on many major benchmarks. DDRO unlocks the
potential for truly data-driven alignment, paving the way for more reliable and
human-aligned LLMs.

Abstract: To further utilize the unsupervised features and pairwise information, we
propose a general Bilevel Clustering Optimization (BCO) framework to improve
the performance of clustering. And then we introduce three special cases on
subspace clustering with two different types of masks. At first, we reformulate
the original subspace clustering as a Basic Masked Subspace Clustering (BMSC),
which reformulate the diagonal constraints to a hard mask. Then, we provide a
General Masked Subspace Clustering (GMSC) method to integrate different
clustering via a soft mask. Furthermore, based on BCO and GMSC, we induce a
learnable soft mask and design a Recursive Masked Subspace Clustering (RMSC)
method that can alternately update the affinity matrix and the soft mask.
Numerical experiments show that our models obtain significant improvement
compared with the baselines on several commonly used datasets, such as MNIST,
USPS, ORL, COIL20 and COIL100.

Conclusion: 混合方法有效提升了预测性能，适用于多领域时间序列数据。

Abstract: Time series forecasting has attracted significant attention, leading to the
de-velopment of a wide range of approaches, from traditional statistical
meth-ods to advanced deep learning models. Among them, the Auto-Regressive
Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model remains a widely adopted linear
technique due to its effectiveness in modeling temporal dependencies in
economic, industrial, and social data. On the other hand, polynomial
classifi-ers offer a robust framework for capturing non-linear relationships
and have demonstrated competitive performance in domains such as stock price
pre-diction. In this study, we propose a hybrid forecasting approach that
inte-grates the ARIMA model with a polynomial classifier to leverage the
com-plementary strengths of both models. The hybrid method is evaluated on
multiple real-world time series datasets spanning diverse domains. Perfor-mance
is assessed based on forecasting accuracy and computational effi-ciency.
Experimental results reveal that the proposed hybrid model consist-ently
outperforms the individual models in terms of prediction accuracy, al-beit with
a modest increase in execution time.

Vision Transformer (ViT) are used to condition the internal process of a
Transformer-based diffusion model. This approach enables
representation-conditioned data generation, addressing the challenge of
requiring large-scale labeled datasets by leveraging self-supervised learning
on unlabeled data. We evaluate our method through a zero-shot classification
task for hematoma detection in brain imaging. Compared to the strong

improvement of +6.15% in accuracy and +13.60% in F1-score, demonstrating its
effectiveness in image classification.

Conclusion: SoftShape通过软稀疏化和形状学习块有效提升分类性能和效率，同时保留可解释性。

Abstract: Shapelets are discriminative subsequences (or shapes) with high
interpretability in time series classification. Due to the time-intensive
nature of shapelet discovery, existing shapelet-based methods mainly focus on
selecting discriminative shapes while discarding others to achieve candidate
subsequence sparsification. However, this approach may exclude beneficial
shapes and overlook the varying contributions of shapelets to classification
performance. To this end, we propose a \textbf{Soft} sparse \textbf{Shape}s
(\textbf{SoftShape}) model for efficient time series classification. Our
approach mainly introduces soft shape sparsification and soft shape learning
blocks. The former transforms shapes into soft representations based on
classification contribution scores, merging lower-scored ones into a single
shape to retain and differentiate all subsequence information. The latter
facilitates intra- and inter-shape temporal pattern learning, improving model
efficiency by using sparsified soft shapes as inputs. Specifically, we employ a
learnable router to activate a subset of class-specific expert networks for
intra-shape pattern learning. Meanwhile, a shared expert network learns
inter-shape patterns by converting sparsified shapes into sequences. Extensive
experiments show that SoftShape outperforms state-of-the-art methods and
produces interpretable results.

Abstract: In the era of big data, data mining has become indispensable for uncovering
hidden patterns and insights from vast and complex datasets. The integration of
multimodal data sources further enhances its potential. Multimodal Federated
Learning (MFL) is a distributed approach that enhances the efficiency and
quality of multimodal learning, ensuring collaborative work and privacy
protection. However, missing modalities pose a significant challenge in MFL,
often due to data quality issues or privacy policies across the clients. In
this work, we present MMiC, a framework for Mitigating Modality incompleteness
in MFL within the Clusters. MMiC replaces partial parameters within client
models inside clusters to mitigate the impact of missing modalities.
Furthermore, it leverages the Banzhaf Power Index to optimize client selection
under these conditions. Finally, MMiC employs an innovative approach to
dynamically control global aggregation by utilizing Markovitz Portfolio
Optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MMiC consistently
outperforms existing federated learning architectures in both global and
personalized performance on multimodal datasets with missing modalities,
confirming the effectiveness of our proposed solution.

Abstract: Time series forecasting has important applications in financial analysis,
weather forecasting, and traffic management. However, existing deep learning
models are limited in processing non-stationary time series data because they
cannot effectively capture the statistical characteristics that change over
time. To address this problem, this paper proposes a new framework, AEFIN,
which enhances the information sharing ability between stable and unstable
components by introducing a cross-attention mechanism, and combines Fourier
analysis networks with MLP to deeply explore the seasonal patterns and trend
characteristics in unstable components. In addition, we design a new loss
function that combines time-domain stability constraints, time-domain
instability constraints, and frequency-domain stability constraints to improve
the accuracy and robustness of forecasting. Experimental results show that
AEFIN outperforms the most common models in terms of mean square error and mean
absolute error, especially under non-stationary data conditions, and shows
excellent forecasting capabilities. This paper provides an innovative solution
for the modeling and forecasting of non-stationary time series data, and
contributes to the research of deep learning for complex time series.

Abstract: Inverse electromagnetic modeling has emerged as a powerful approach for
designing complex microwave structures with high accuracy and efficiency. In
this study, we propose an Iterative Residual Correction Network (IRC-Net) for
the inverse design of Ku-band Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) components
based on multimode resonators. We use a multimode resonance structure to
demonstrate that it is possible to control the resonances of the structure.
Therefore, these structures can be used for resonant components and smart
filter design. The proposed deep learning architecture leverages residual
neural networks to overcome the limitations of traditional inverse design
techniques, such as the Feedforward Inverse Model (FIM), offering improved
generalization and prediction accuracy. The approach begins with a FIM to
generate initial design estimates, followed by an iterative correction strategy
inspired by the Hybrid Inverse-Forward Residual Refinement Network
(HiFR\textsuperscript{2}-Net), which we call IRC-Net. Experiments demonstrate
that the IRC-Net achieves substantial improvements in prediction accuracy
compared to traditional single-stage networks, validated through statistical
metrics, full-wave electromagnetic simulations, and measurements. To validate
the proposed framework, we first design and fabricate a three-resonance SIW
structure. Next, we apply the trained IRC-Net model to predict the geometry of
a four-resonance structure based on its desired frequency response. Both
designs are fabricated and tested, showing strong agreement between the
simulated, predicted, and measured results, confirming the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed method.

Result: SSDP模型优于MDP，能明确表示增强决策的信息集，并通过VoI优化目标设计了奖励函数。

Conclusion: 该方法在车辆跟随控制问题中验证了潜力，适用于广泛的网络控制系统联合优化。

Abstract: As Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) evolves towards future
sixth-generation (6G) networks, Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are
emerging to become a key application. Leveraging data-driven Machine Learning
(ML), especially Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), is expected to
significantly enhance CAV decision-making in both vehicle control and V2X
communication under uncertainty. These two decision-making processes are
closely intertwined, with the value of information (VoI) acting as a crucial
bridge between them. In this paper, we introduce Sequential Stochastic Decision
Process (SSDP) models to define and assess VoI, demonstrating their application
in optimizing communication systems for CAVs. Specifically, we formally define
the SSDP model and demonstrate that the MDP model is a special case of it. The
SSDP model offers a key advantage by explicitly representing the set of
information that can enhance decision-making when available. Furthermore, as
current research on VoI remains fragmented, we propose a systematic VoI
modeling framework grounded in the MDP, Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Optimal
Control theories. We define different categories of VoI and discuss their
corresponding estimation methods. Finally, we present a structured approach to
leverage the various VoI metrics for optimizing the ``When", ``What", and
``How" to communicate problems. For this purpose, SSDP models are formulated
with VoI-associated reward functions derived from VoI-based optimization
objectives. While we use a simple vehicle-following control problem to
illustrate the proposed methodology, it holds significant potential to
facilitate the joint optimization of stochastic, sequential control and
communication decisions in a wide range of networked control systems.

Result: GuidedQuant在多种量化任务中表现优异，新算法在非均匀标量量化中表现最佳。

Conclusion: GuidedQuant显著提升了量化性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Post-training quantization is a key technique for reducing the memory and
inference latency of large language models by quantizing weights and
activations without requiring retraining. However, existing methods either (1)
fail to account for the varying importance of hidden features to the end loss
or, when incorporating end loss, (2) neglect the critical interactions between
model weights. To address these limitations, we propose GuidedQuant, a novel
quantization approach that integrates gradient information from the end loss
into the quantization objective while preserving cross-weight dependencies
within output channels. GuidedQuant consistently boosts the performance of
state-of-the-art quantization methods across weight-only scalar, weight-only
vector, and weight-and-activation quantization. Additionally, we introduce a
novel non-uniform scalar quantization algorithm, which is guaranteed to
monotonically decrease the quantization objective value, and outperforms
existing methods in this category. We release the code at

Abstract: We study the problem of monitoring machine learning models under gradual
distribution shifts, where circumstances change slowly over time, often leading
to unnoticed yet significant declines in accuracy. To address this, we propose
Incremental Uncertainty-aware Performance Monitoring (IUPM), a novel label-free
method that estimates performance changes by modeling gradual shifts using
optimal transport. In addition, IUPM quantifies the uncertainty in the
performance prediction and introduces an active labeling procedure to restore a
reliable estimate under a limited labeling budget. Our experiments show that
IUPM outperforms existing performance estimation baselines in various gradual
shift scenarios and that its uncertainty awareness guides label acquisition
more effectively compared to other strategies.

Abstract: Machine unlearning is essential for meeting legal obligations such as the
right to be forgotten, which requires the removal of specific data from machine
learning models upon request. While several approaches to unlearning have been
proposed, existing solutions often struggle with efficiency and, more
critically, with the verification of unlearning - particularly in the case of
weak unlearning guarantees, where verification remains an open challenge. We
introduce a generalized variant of the standard unlearning metric that enables
more efficient and precise unlearning strategies. We also present an
unlearning-aware training procedure that, in many cases, allows for exact
unlearning. We term our approach MaxRR. When exact unlearning is not feasible,
MaxRR still supports efficient unlearning with properties closely matching
those achieved through full retraining.

Abstract: Diabetes remains a significant health challenge globally, contributing to
severe complications like kidney disease, vision loss, and heart issues. The
application of machine learning (ML) in healthcare enables efficient and
accurate disease prediction, offering avenues for early intervention and
patient support. Our study introduces an innovative diabetes prediction
framework, leveraging both traditional ML techniques such as Logistic
Regression, SVM, Na\"ive Bayes, and Random Forest and advanced ensemble methods
like AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Extra Trees, and XGBoost. Central to our
approach is the development of a novel model, DNet, a hybrid architecture
combining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
layers for effective feature extraction and sequential learning. The DNet model
comprises an initial convolutional block for capturing essential features,
followed by a residual block with skip connections to facilitate efficient
information flow. Batch Normalization and Dropout are employed for robust
regularization, and an LSTM layer captures temporal dependencies within the
data. Using a Kaggle-sourced real-world diabetes dataset, our model evaluation
spans cross-validation accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
Among the models, DNet demonstrates the highest efficacy with an accuracy of
99.79% and an AUC-ROC of 99.98%, establishing its potential for superior
diabetes prediction. This robust hybrid architecture showcases the value of
combining CNN and LSTM layers, emphasizing its applicability in medical
diagnostics and disease prediction tasks.

Result: 气候背景显著影响RL策略的效果与可转移性，热气候城市在能耗与舒适度平衡上表现更优。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based heating, ventilation, and air conditioning
(HVAC) control has emerged as a promising technology for reducing building
energy consumption while maintaining indoor thermal comfort. However, the
efficacy of such strategies is influenced by the background climate and their
implementation may potentially alter both the indoor climate and local urban
climate. This study proposes an integrated framework combining RL with an urban
climate model that incorporates a building energy model, aiming to evaluate the
efficacy of RL-based HVAC control across different background climates, impacts
of RL strategies on indoor climate and local urban climate, and the
transferability of RL strategies across cities. Our findings reveal that the
reward (defined as a weighted combination of energy consumption and thermal
comfort) and the impacts of RL strategies on indoor climate and local urban
climate exhibit marked variability across cities with different background
climates. The sensitivity of reward weights and the transferability of RL
strategies are also strongly influenced by the background climate. Cities in
hot climates tend to achieve higher rewards across most reward weight
configurations that balance energy consumption and thermal comfort, and those
cities with more varying atmospheric temperatures demonstrate greater RL
strategy transferability. These findings underscore the importance of
thoroughly evaluating RL-based HVAC control strategies in diverse climatic
contexts. This study also provides a new insight that city-to-city learning
will potentially aid the deployment of RL-based HVAC control.

Abstract: How do neural language models acquire a language's structure when trained for
next-token prediction? We address this question by deriving theoretical scaling
laws for neural network performance on synthetic datasets generated by the
Random Hierarchy Model (RHM) -- an ensemble of probabilistic context-free
grammars designed to capture the hierarchical structure of natural language
while remaining analytically tractable. Previously, we developed a theory of
representation learning based on data correlations that explains how deep
learning models capture the hierarchical structure of the data sequentially,
one layer at a time. Here, we extend our theoretical framework to account for
architectural differences. In particular, we predict and empirically validate
that convolutional networks, whose structure aligns with that of the generative
process through locality and weight sharing, enjoy a faster scaling of
performance compared to transformer models, which rely on global self-attention
mechanisms. This finding clarifies the architectural biases underlying neural
scaling laws and highlights how representation learning is shaped by the
interaction between model architecture and the statistical properties of data.

Conclusion: 常见补救解释在药物发现或计算生物学等应用中具有潜力，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in various domains such as
social networks, molecular biology, or recommendation systems. Concurrently,
different explanations methods of GNNs have arisen to complement its black-box
nature. Explanations of the GNNs' predictions can be categorized into two
types--factual and counterfactual. Given a GNN trained on binary classification
into ''accept'' and ''reject'' classes, a global counterfactual explanation
consists in generating a small set of ''accept'' graphs relevant to all of the
input ''reject'' graphs. The transformation of a ''reject'' graph into an
''accept'' graph is called a recourse. A common recourse explanation is a small
set of recourse, from which every ''reject'' graph can be turned into an
''accept'' graph. Although local counterfactual explanations have been studied
extensively, the problem of finding common recourse for global counterfactual
explanation remains unexplored, particularly for GNNs. In this paper, we
formalize the common recourse explanation problem, and design an effective
algorithm, COMRECGC, to solve it. We benchmark our algorithm against strong
baselines on four different real-world graphs datasets and demonstrate the
superior performance of COMRECGC against the competitors. We also compare the
common recourse explanations to the graph counterfactual explanation, showing
that common recourse explanations are either comparable or superior, making
them worth considering for applications such as drug discovery or computational
biology.

Motivation: 解决生物分子设计中多目标冲突的挑战，现有方法仅适用于单一目标或需要连续嵌入，可能扭曲离散分布。

Method: 提出MOG-DFM框架，结合混合排名-方向评分和自适应超锥过滤器，指导预训练的离散流匹配生成器实现多目标帕累托优化。

Result: 成功应用于优化肽结合物的五个属性和设计具有特定增强子类别及DNA形状的DNA序列。

Conclusion: MOG-DFM是一种强大的工具，适用于多属性导向的生物分子序列设计。

Abstract: Designing biological sequences that satisfy multiple, often conflicting,
functional and biophysical criteria remains a central challenge in biomolecule
engineering. While discrete flow matching models have recently shown promise
for efficient sampling in high-dimensional sequence spaces, existing approaches
address only single objectives or require continuous embeddings that can
distort discrete distributions. We present Multi-Objective-Guided Discrete Flow
Matching (MOG-DFM), a general framework to steer any pretrained discrete-time
flow matching generator toward Pareto-efficient trade-offs across multiple
scalar objectives. At each sampling step, MOG-DFM computes a hybrid
rank-directional score for candidate transitions and applies an adaptive
hypercone filter to enforce consistent multi-objective progression. We also
trained two unconditional discrete flow matching models, PepDFM for diverse
peptide generation and EnhancerDFM for functional enhancer DNA generation, as
base generation models for MOG-DFM. We demonstrate MOG-DFM's effectiveness in
generating peptide binders optimized across five properties (hemolysis,
non-fouling, solubility, half-life, and binding affinity), and in designing DNA
sequences with specific enhancer classes and DNA shapes. In total, MOG-DFM
proves to be a powerful tool for multi-property-guided biomolecule sequence
design.

Result: 在简单梁和KW-51桥上验证，达到有限元精度，推理速度比GRU-based DeepONet快100倍以上。

Conclusion: MIONet适用于实时结构监测和数字孪生应用，具有高效、连续和准确的优点。

Abstract: Finite element (FE) modeling is essential for structural analysis but remains
computationally intensive, especially under dynamic loading. While operator
learning models have shown promise in replicating static structural responses
at FEM level accuracy, modeling dynamic behavior remains more challenging. This
work presents a Multiple Input Operator Network (MIONet) that incorporates a
second trunk network to explicitly encode temporal dynamics, enabling accurate
prediction of structural responses under moving loads. Traditional DeepONet
architectures using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are limited by fixed time
discretization and struggle to capture continuous dynamics. In contrast, MIONet
predicts responses continuously over both space and time, removing the need for
step wise modeling. It maps scalar inputs including load type, velocity,
spatial mesh, and time steps to full field structural responses. To improve
efficiency and enforce physical consistency, we introduce a physics informed
loss based on dynamic equilibrium using precomputed mass, damping, and
stiffness matrices, without solving the governing PDEs directly. Further, a
Schur complement formulation reduces the training domain, significantly cutting
computational costs while preserving global accuracy. The model is validated on
both a simple beam and the KW-51 bridge, achieving FEM level accuracy within
seconds. Compared to GRU based DeepONet, our model offers comparable accuracy
with improved temporal continuity and over 100 times faster inference, making
it well suited for real-time structural monitoring and digital twin
applications.

Result: 实验结果显示，个性化配置能生成适应个体需求的模型，同时保持高解释性，用户对模型的理解度较高。

Conclusion: 研究表明，个性化可解释机器学习具有潜力，为未来研究提供了初步见解。

Abstract: The Rashomon effect describes the observation that in machine learning (ML)
multiple models often achieve similar predictive performance while explaining
the underlying relationships in different ways. This observation holds even for
intrinsically interpretable models, such as Generalized Additive Models (GAMs),
which offer users valuable insights into the model's behavior. Given the
existence of multiple GAM configurations with similar predictive performance, a
natural question is whether we can personalize these configurations based on
users' needs for interpretability. In our study, we developed an approach to
personalize models based on contextual bandits. In an online experiment with
108 users in a personalized treatment and a non-personalized control group, we
found that personalization led to individualized rather than one-size-fits-all
configurations. Despite these individual adjustments, the interpretability
remained high across both groups, with users reporting a strong understanding
of the models. Our research offers initial insights into the potential for
personalizing interpretable ML.

Abstract: Estimating parameters from samples of an optimal probability distribution is
essential in applications ranging from socio-economic modeling to biological
system analysis. In these settings, the probability distribution arises as the
solution to an optimization problem that captures either static interactions
among agents or the dynamic evolution of a system over time. Our approach
relies on minimizing a new class of loss functions, called sharpened
Fenchel-Young losses, which measure the sub-optimality gap of the optimization
problem over the space of measures. We study the stability of this estimation
method when only a finite number of sample is available. The parameters to be
estimated typically correspond to a cost function in static problems and to a
potential function in dynamic problems. To analyze stability, we introduce a
general methodology that leverages the strong convexity of the loss function
together with the sample complexity of the forward optimization problem. Our
analysis emphasizes two specific settings in the context of optimal transport,
where our method provides explicit stability guarantees: The first is inverse
unbalanced optimal transport (iUOT) with entropic regularization, where the
parameters to estimate are cost functions that govern transport computations;
this method has applications such as link prediction in machine learning. The
second is inverse gradient flow (iJKO), where the objective is to recover a
potential function that drives the evolution of a probability distribution via
the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) time-discretization scheme; this is
particularly relevant for understanding cell population dynamics in single-cell
genomics. Finally, we validate our approach through numerical experiments on
Gaussian distributions, where closed-form solutions are available, to
demonstrate the practical performance of our methods

Result: 实验表明，AugMixCloak在多种数据集和拓扑结构下均能有效防御MIA，优于正则化和置信度掩码方法。

Conclusion: AugMixCloak提供了更强的隐私保护，且泛化能力更佳。

Abstract: Traditional machine learning (ML) raises serious privacy concerns, while
federated learning (FL) mitigates the risk of data leakage by keeping data on
local devices. However, the training process of FL can still leak sensitive
information, which adversaries may exploit to infer private data. One of the
most prominent threats is the membership inference attack (MIA), where the
adversary aims to determine whether a particular data record was part of the
training set.
  This paper addresses this problem through a two-stage defense called
AugMixCloak. The core idea is to apply data augmentation and principal
component analysis (PCA)-based information fusion to query images, which are
detected by perceptual hashing (pHash) as either identical to or highly similar
to images in the training set. Experimental results show that AugMixCloak
successfully defends against both binary classifier-based MIA and metric-based
MIA across five datasets and various decentralized FL (DFL) topologies.
Compared with regularization-based defenses, AugMixCloak demonstrates stronger
protection. Compared with confidence score masking, AugMixCloak exhibits better
generalization.

Abstract: Time series imputation is one of the most challenge problems and has broad
applications in various fields like health care and the Internet of Things.
Existing methods mainly aim to model the temporally latent dependencies and the
generation process from the observed time series data. In real-world scenarios,
different types of missing mechanisms, like MAR (Missing At Random), and MNAR
(Missing Not At Random) can occur in time series data. However, existing
methods often overlook the difference among the aforementioned missing
mechanisms and use a single model for time series imputation, which can easily
lead to misleading results due to mechanism mismatching. In this paper, we
propose a framework for time series imputation problem by exploring Different
Missing Mechanisms (DMM in short) and tailoring solutions accordingly.
Specifically, we first analyze the data generation processes with temporal
latent states and missing cause variables for different mechanisms.
Sequentially, we model these generation processes via variational inference and
estimate prior distributions of latent variables via normalizing flow-based
neural architecture. Furthermore, we establish identifiability results under
the nonlinear independent component analysis framework to show that latent
variables are identifiable. Experimental results show that our method surpasses
existing time series imputation techniques across various datasets with
different missing mechanisms, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world
applications.

Abstract: Complexity science offers a wide range of measures for quantifying
unpredictability, structure, and information. Yet, a systematic conceptual
organization of these measures is still missing.
  We present a unified framework that locates statistical, algorithmic, and
dynamical measures along three axes (regularity, randomness, and complexity)
and situates them in a common conceptual space. We map statistical,
algorithmic, and dynamical measures into this conceptual space, discussing
their computational accessibility and approximability.
  This taxonomy reveals the deep challenges posed by uncomputability and
highlights the emergence of modern data-driven methods (including autoencoders,
latent dynamical models, symbolic regression, and physics-informed neural
networks) as pragmatic approximations to classical complexity ideals. Latent
spaces emerge as operational arenas where regularity extraction, noise
management, and structured compression converge, bridging theoretical
foundations with practical modeling in high-dimensional systems.
  We close by outlining implications for physics-informed AI and AI-guided
discovery in complex physical systems, arguing that classical questions of
complexity remain central to next-generation scientific modeling.

Abstract: Predicting future vehicle purchases among existing owners presents a critical
challenge due to extreme class imbalance (<0.5% positive rate) and complex
behavioral patterns. We propose REMEDI (Relative feature Enhanced Meta-learning

addressing these challenges. REMEDI first trains diverse base models to capture
complementary aspects of user behavior. Second, inspired by comparative
op-timization techniques, we introduce relative performance meta-features
(deviation from ensemble mean, rank among peers) for effective model fusion
through a hybrid-expert architecture. Third, we distill the ensemble's
knowledge into a single efficient model via supervised fine-tuning with MSE
loss, enabling practical deployment. Evaluated on approximately 800,000 vehicle
owners, REMEDI significantly outperforms baseline approaches, achieving the
business target of identifying ~50% of actual buyers within the top 60,000
recommendations at ~10% precision. The distilled model preserves the ensemble's

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising
approach for scaling Transformer models. While initial works primarily
incorporated MoE into feed-forward network (FFN) layers, recent studies have
explored extending the MoE paradigm to attention layers to enhance model
performance. However, existing attention-based MoE layers require specialized
implementations and demonstrate suboptimal performance compared to their
FFN-based counterparts. In this paper, we aim to unify the MoE designs in
attention and FFN layers by introducing a novel reformulation of the attention
mechanism, revealing an underlying FFN-like structure within attention modules.
Our proposed architecture, UMoE, achieves superior performance through
attention-based MoE layers while enabling efficient parameter sharing between
FFN and attention components.

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) as priors in reinforcement learning
(RL) offers significant advantages but comes with substantial computational
costs. We present a principled cache-efficient framework for posterior sampling
with LLM-derived priors that dramatically reduces these costs while maintaining
high performance. At the core of our approach is an adaptive caching mechanism,
where cache parameters are meta-optimized using surrogate gradients derived
from policy performance. This design enables efficient inference across both
discrete text environments (e.g., TextWorld, ALFWorld) and continuous control
domains (e.g., MuJoCo), achieving a 3.8--4.7$\times$ reduction in LLM queries
and 4.0--12.0$\times$ lower median latencies (85--93\,ms on a consumer GPU)
while retaining 96--98\% of uncached performance. Our theoretical analysis
provides KL divergence bounds on approximation quality, validated empirically.
The framework extends to offline RL, where our CQL-Prior variant improves
performance by 14--29\% and reduces training time by 38--40\%. Extensive
evaluations across a diverse suite of eight tasks demonstrate the
generalizability and practical viability of LLM-guided RL in
resource-constrained settings.

TLDR: INTELLECT-2是全球首个分布式异步强化学习训练的320亿参数语言模型，采用去中心化计算资源，并开源代码和数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动去中心化训练研究，解决传统集中式训练的局限性。

Method: 开发PRIME-RL框架，包含TOPLOC和SHARDCAST组件，改进GRPO训练方法和数据过滤技术。

Result: 成功训练出优于现有320亿参数推理模型QwQ-32B的模型。

Conclusion: INTELLECT-2为去中心化训练领域提供了开源工具和框架，促进开放研究。

Abstract: We introduce INTELLECT-2, the first globally distributed reinforcement
learning (RL) training run of a 32 billion parameter language model. Unlike
traditional centralized training efforts, INTELLECT-2 trains a reasoning model
using fully asynchronous RL across a dynamic, heterogeneous swarm of
permissionless compute contributors.
  To enable a training run with this unique infrastructure, we built various
components from scratch: we introduce PRIME-RL, our training framework
purpose-built for distributed asynchronous reinforcement learning, based on top
of novel components such as TOPLOC, which verifies rollouts from untrusted
inference workers, and SHARDCAST, which efficiently broadcasts policy weights
from training nodes to inference workers.
  Beyond infrastructure components, we propose modifications to the standard
GRPO training recipe and data filtering techniques that were crucial to achieve
training stability and ensure that our model successfully learned its training
objective, thus improving upon QwQ-32B, the state of the art reasoning model in
the 32B parameter range.
  We open-source INTELLECT-2 along with all of our code and data, hoping to
encourage and enable more open research in the field of decentralized training.

Motivation: 将强化学习（RL）从线性损失扩展到凸损失，解决非线性CURL问题中经典Bellman方程失效的挑战。

Method: 采用在线镜像下降算法，结合动态约束集和精心设计的探索奖励，并针对反馈受限的bandit版本问题，借鉴bandit凸优化技术。

Result: 实现了无需先验知识的近最优遗憾边界，并在bandit版本中达到了次线性遗憾。

Conclusion: 该算法为CURL问题提供了有效的解决方案，扩展了RL在非线性目标下的应用范围。

Abstract: We study online learning in episodic finite-horizon Markov decision processes
(MDPs) with convex objective functions, known as the concave utility
reinforcement learning (CURL) problem. This setting generalizes RL from linear
to convex losses on the state-action distribution induced by the agent's
policy. The non-linearity of CURL invalidates classical Bellman equations and
requires new algorithmic approaches. We introduce the first algorithm achieving
near-optimal regret bounds for online CURL without any prior knowledge on the
transition function. To achieve this, we use an online mirror descent algorithm
with varying constraint sets and a carefully designed exploration bonus. We
then address for the first time a bandit version of CURL, where the only
feedback is the value of the objective function on the state-action
distribution induced by the agent's policy. We achieve a sub-linear regret
bound for this more challenging problem by adapting techniques from bandit
convex optimization to the MDP setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 论文提出了一种系统性框架，将大语言模型（LLM）的不确定性分解为四种来源，并开发了量化方法。通过实验验证，该框架能帮助选择适合任务的模型或不确定性指标，提升可靠性。


<details>

Motivation: 大语言模型常生成流畅但不准确的输出（幻觉），现有不确定性指标解释性不足，无法明确捕捉不确定性类型。

Method: 提出分解LLM不确定性的框架，开发量化方法，并通过实验评估指标与任务、模型的关系。

Result: 实验表明，指标、任务和模型在不确定性特征上存在系统性差异，提出的方法能有效选择适合任务的模型或指标。

Conclusion: 不确定性感知的选择策略优于基线方法，有助于提升不确定性估计的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate fluent but factually incorrect
outputs, known as hallucinations, which undermine their reliability in
real-world applications. While uncertainty estimation has emerged as a
promising strategy for detecting such errors, current metrics offer limited
interpretability and lack clarity about the types of uncertainty they capture.
In this paper, we present a systematic framework for decomposing LLM
uncertainty into four distinct sources, inspired by previous research. We
develop a source-specific estimation pipeline to quantify these uncertainty
types and evaluate how existing metrics relate to each source across tasks and
models. Our results show that metrics, task, and model exhibit systematic
variation in uncertainty characteristic. Building on this, we propose a method
for task specific metric/model selection guided by the alignment or divergence
between their uncertainty characteristics and that of a given task. Our
experiments across datasets and models demonstrate that our uncertainty-aware
selection strategy consistently outperforms baseline strategies, helping us
select appropriate models or uncertainty metrics, and contributing to more
reliable and efficient deployment in uncertainty estimation.

Conclusion: ACTLL框架有效提升噪声标签下的预测性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Medical research, particularly in predicting patient outcomes, heavily relies
on medical time series data extracted from Electronic Health Records (EHR),
which provide extensive information on patient histories. Despite rigorous
examination, labeling errors are inevitable and can significantly impede
accurate predictions of patient outcome. To address this challenge, we propose
an \textbf{A}ttention-based Learning Framework with Dynamic
\textbf{C}alibration and Augmentation for \textbf{T}ime series Noisy
\textbf{L}abel \textbf{L}earning (ACTLL). This framework leverages a
two-component Beta mixture model to identify the certain and uncertain sets of
instances based on the fitness distribution of each class, and it captures
global temporal dynamics while dynamically calibrating labels from the
uncertain set or augmenting confident instances from the certain set.
Experimental results on large-scale EHR datasets eICU and MIMIC-IV-ED, and
several benchmark datasets from the UCR and UEA repositories, demonstrate that
our model ACTLL has achieved state-of-the-art performance, especially under
high noise levels.

TLDR: GenRe是一种生成式追索模型，通过联合训练三个追索目标（接近性、合理性和有效性）来提供更优的追索建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在训练时单独处理追索目标，推理时通过联合优化搜索追索建议，导致效果不佳。

Method: 提出GenRe模型，通过合成监督信号联合训练生成模型，并在推理时通过前向采样生成最低成本的追索建议。

Result: GenRe在多个指标上表现优异，并在成本、合理性和有效性之间取得最佳平衡。

Conclusion: GenRe通过联合训练和高效推理，显著提升了追索建议的质量。

Abstract: Algorithmic Recourse provides recommendations to individuals who are
adversely impacted by automated model decisions, on how to alter their profiles
to achieve a favorable outcome. Effective recourse methods must balance three
conflicting goals: proximity to the original profile to minimize cost,
plausibility for realistic recourse, and validity to ensure the desired
outcome. We show that existing methods train for these objectives separately
and then search for recourse through a joint optimization over the recourse
goals during inference, leading to poor recourse recommendations. We introduce
GenRe, a generative recourse model designed to train the three recourse
objectives jointly. Training such generative models is non-trivial due to lack
of direct recourse supervision. We propose efficient ways to synthesize such
supervision and further show that GenRe's training leads to a consistent
estimator. Unlike most prior methods, that employ non-robust gradient descent
based search during inference, GenRe simply performs a forward sampling over
the generative model to produce minimum cost recourse, leading to superior
performance across multiple metrics. We also demonstrate GenRe provides the
best trade-off between cost, plausibility and validity, compared to
state-of-art baselines. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 研究自选数据方法（如主动学习、半监督学习等）在泛化能力上的表现，统一为“互惠学习”框架，并探讨其理论保证。

Method: 使用覆盖数和Wasserstein模糊集证明通用泛化界，无需数据分布假设，仅需算法可验证条件。

Result: 提出了适用于收敛和有限迭代解的泛化界，后者具有随时有效性，支持停止规则以保证样本外性能。

Conclusion: 通过半监督学习的实例验证了理论结果，为互惠学习提供了理论支持和实用工具。

Abstract: Many learning paradigms self-select training data in light of previously
learned parameters. Examples include active learning, semi-supervised learning,
bandits, or boosting. Rodemann et al. (2024) unify them under the framework of
"reciprocal learning". In this article, we address the question of how well
these methods can generalize from their self-selected samples. In particular,
we prove universal generalization bounds for reciprocal learning using covering
numbers and Wasserstein ambiguity sets. Our results require no assumptions on
the distribution of self-selected data, only verifiable conditions on the
algorithms. We prove results for both convergent and finite iteration
solutions. The latter are anytime valid, thereby giving rise to stopping rules
for a practitioner seeking to guarantee the out-of-sample performance of their
reciprocal learning algorithm. Finally, we illustrate our bounds and stopping
rules for reciprocal learning's special case of semi-supervised learning.

Conclusion: ICE-Pruning在保持准确性的同时显著提高了剪枝效率。

Abstract: Pruning is a widely used method for compressing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs),
where less relevant parameters are removed from a DNN model to reduce its size.
However, removing parameters reduces model accuracy, so pruning is typically
combined with fine-tuning, and sometimes other operations such as rewinding
weights, to recover accuracy. A common approach is to repeatedly prune and then
fine-tune, with increasing amounts of model parameters being removed in each
step. While straightforward to implement, pruning pipelines that follow this
approach are computationally expensive due to the need for repeated
fine-tuning.
  In this paper we propose ICE-Pruning, an iterative pruning pipeline for DNNs
that significantly decreases the time required for pruning by reducing the
overall cost of fine-tuning, while maintaining a similar accuracy to existing
pruning pipelines. ICE-Pruning is based on three main components: i) an
automatic mechanism to determine after which pruning steps fine-tuning should
be performed; ii) a freezing strategy for faster fine-tuning in each pruning
step; and iii) a custom pruning-aware learning rate scheduler to further
improve the accuracy of each pruning step and reduce the overall time
consumption. We also propose an efficient auto-tuning stage for the
hyperparameters (e.g., freezing percentage) introduced by the three components.
We evaluate ICE-Pruning on several DNN models and datasets, showing that it can
accelerate pruning by up to 9.61x. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要手动提取统计特征来确定惩罚参数，过程繁琐且可能不准确。

Method: 使用循环神经网络直接从原始数据序列中学习惩罚参数，自动提取特征。

Result: 在20个基准基因组数据集上的实验表明，新方法在多数情况下优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 新方法通过自动学习惩罚参数，提高了变化点检测的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Changepoint detection identifies significant shifts in data sequences, making
it important in areas like finance, genetics, and healthcare. The Optimal
Partitioning algorithms efficiently detect these changes, using a penalty
parameter to limit the changepoints number. Determining the appropriate value
for this penalty can be challenging. Traditionally, this process involved
manually extracting statistical features, such as sequence length or variance
to make the prediction. This study proposes a novel approach that uses
recurrent neural networks to learn this penalty directly from raw sequences by
automatically extracting features. Experiments conducted on 20 benchmark
genomic datasets show that this novel method surpasses traditional methods in
partitioning accuracy in most cases.

TLDR: LEAD是一种高效迭代数据选择框架，通过实例级动态不确定性（IDU）和两阶段选择策略，显著提升模型性能并减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有迭代数据选择方法依赖重复全数据集模型推理，计算成本高，效率低。

Method: LEAD引入IDU（结合训练损失、梯度近似损失变化和历史损失平滑），并采用两阶段粗到细选择策略。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，LEAD平均性能提升6.1%-10.8%，仅需2.5%训练数据，训练时间减少5-10倍。

Conclusion: LEAD通过高效数据选择和优化计算，显著提升了模型性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Instruction tuning has emerged as a critical paradigm for improving the
capabilities and alignment of large language models (LLMs). However, existing
iterative model-aware data selection methods incur significant computational
overhead, as they rely on repeatedly performing full-dataset model inference to
estimate sample utility for subsequent training iterations, creating a
fundamental efficiency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose LEAD, an efficient
iterative data selection framework that accurately estimates sample utility
entirely within the standard training loop, eliminating the need for costly
additional model inference. At its core, LEAD introduces Instance-Level Dynamic
Uncertainty (IDU), a theoretically grounded utility function combining
instantaneous training loss, gradient-based approximation of loss changes, and
exponential smoothing of historical loss signals. To further scale efficiently
to large datasets, LEAD employs a two-stage, coarse-to-fine selection strategy,
adaptively prioritizing informative clusters through a multi-armed bandit
mechanism, followed by precise fine-grained selection of high-utility samples
using IDU. Extensive experiments across four diverse benchmarks show that LEAD
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving average model
performance by 6.1%-10.8% while using only 2.5% of the training data and
reducing overall training time by 5-10x.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种统一的连续生成模型框架（UCGM-{T,S}），整合了多步和少步生成模型的训练与采样方法，并在性能上达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常将多步（如扩散模型）和少步（如一致性模型）生成方法视为独立范式，导致训练和采样方法分离。本文旨在统一这些方法。

Method: 提出UCGM-{T,S}框架，统一训练、采样和分析多步与少步生成模型。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，UCGM-T训练的多步模型在20步达到1.30 FID，少步模型在2步达到1.42 FID；UCGM-S将预训练模型的性能从250步的1.26 FID提升到40步的1.06 FID。

Conclusion: UCGM框架成功统一了多步和少步生成模型，显著提升了生成效率和性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in continuous generative models, including multi-step
approaches like diffusion and flow-matching (typically requiring 8-1000
sampling steps) and few-step methods such as consistency models (typically 1-8
steps), have demonstrated impressive generative performance. However, existing
work often treats these approaches as distinct paradigms, resulting in separate
training and sampling methodologies. We introduce a unified framework for
training, sampling, and analyzing these models. Our implementation, the Unified
Continuous Generative Models Trainer and Sampler (UCGM-{T,S}), achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. For example, on ImageNet 256x256 using a
675M diffusion transformer, UCGM-T trains a multi-step model achieving 1.30 FID
in 20 steps and a few-step model reaching 1.42 FID in just 2 steps.
Additionally, applying UCGM-S to a pre-trained model (previously 1.26 FID at
250 steps) improves performance to 1.06 FID in only 40 steps. Code is available

Conclusion: PAH框架在持续学习中表现优异，无需存储样本或分类头即可超越现有方法。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to learn a sequence of tasks without forgetting
prior knowledge, but gradient updates for a new task often overwrite the
weights learned earlier, causing catastrophic forgetting (CF). We propose
Prototype-Augmented Hypernetworks (PAH), a framework where a single
hypernetwork, conditioned on learnable task prototypes, dynamically generates
task-specific classifier heads on demand. To mitigate forgetting, PAH combines
cross-entropy with dual distillation losses, one to align logits and another to
align prototypes, ensuring stable feature representations across tasks.
Evaluations on Split-CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet demonstrate that PAH achieves
state-of-the-art performance, reaching 74.5 % and 63.7 % accuracy with only 1.7
% and 4.4 % forgetting, respectively, surpassing prior methods without storing
samples or heads.

Conclusion: SDO是一种通用、高效且计算轻量的方法，适用于扩散模型的所有参数类型优化。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success in
modeling large-scale data distributions. However, many downstream tasks require
guiding the generated content based on specific differentiable metrics,
typically necessitating backpropagation during the generation process. This
approach is computationally expensive, as generating with DMs often demands
tens to hundreds of recursive network calls, resulting in high memory usage and
significant time consumption. In this paper, we propose a more efficient
alternative that approaches the problem from the perspective of parallel
denoising. We show that full backpropagation throughout the entire generation
process is unnecessary. The downstream metrics can be optimized by retaining
the computational graph of only one step during generation, thus providing a
shortcut for gradient propagation. The resulting method, which we call Shortcut
Diffusion Optimization (SDO), is generic, high-performance, and computationally
lightweight, capable of optimizing all parameter types in diffusion sampling.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of SDO on several real-world tasks, including
controlling generation by optimizing latent and aligning the DMs by fine-tuning
network parameters. Compared to full backpropagation, our approach reduces
computational costs by $\sim 90\%$ while maintaining superior performance. Code

Abstract: Telling apart the cause and effect between two random variables with purely
observational data is a challenging problem that finds applications in various
scientific disciplines. A key principle utilized in this task is the
algorithmic Markov condition, which postulates that the joint distribution,
when factorized according to the causal direction, yields a more succinct
codelength compared to the anti-causal direction. Previous approaches
approximate these codelengths by relying on simple functions or Gaussian
processes (GPs) with easily evaluable complexity, compromising between model
fitness and computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose
leveraging the variational Bayesian learning of neural networks as an
interpretation of the codelengths. Consequently, we can enhance the model
fitness while promoting the succinctness of the codelengths, while avoiding the
significant computational complexity of the GP-based approaches. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks in cause-effect
identification demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, surpassing
the overall performance of related complexity-based and structural causal model
regression-based approaches.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection is a popular and vital task in various real-world
scenarios, which has been studied for several decades. Recently, many studies
extending deep learning-based methods have shown preferable performance on
graph anomaly detection. However, existing methods are lack of efficiency that
is definitely necessary for embedded devices. Towards this end, we propose an
Efficient Anomaly detection model on heterogeneous Graphs via contrastive
LEarning (EAGLE) by contrasting abnormal nodes with normal ones in terms of
their distances to the local context. The proposed method first samples
instance pairs on meta path-level for contrastive learning. Then, a graph
autoencoder-based model is applied to learn informative node embeddings in an
unsupervised way, which will be further combined with the discriminator to
predict the anomaly scores of nodes. Experimental results show that EAGLE
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three heterogeneous network

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has become an effective and widely used approach to
training deep learning models on decentralized datasets held by distinct
clients. FL also strengthens both security and privacy protections for training
data. Common challenges associated with statistical heterogeneity between
distributed datasets have spurred significant interest in personalized FL (pFL)
methods, where models combine aspects of global learning with local modeling
specific to each client's unique characteristics. In this work, the efficacy of
theoretically supported, adaptive MMD measures within the Ditto framework, a
state-of-the-art technique in pFL, are investigated. The use of such measures
significantly improves model performance across a variety of tasks, especially
those with pronounced feature heterogeneity. While the Ditto algorithm is
specifically considered, such measures are directly applicable to a number of
other pFL settings, and the results motivate the use of constraints tailored to
the various kinds of heterogeneity expected in FL systems.

Result: 实验表明，KRPO能提升GRPO的稳定性和性能，尤其在动态奖励信号难以建模的环境中。

Conclusion: KRPO是一种简单有效的改进方法，适用于语言模型在复杂奖励环境中的策略优化。

Abstract: Reward baseline is important for Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms to
reduce variance in policy gradient estimates. Recently, for language modeling,
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is proposed to compute the advantage
for each output by subtracting the mean reward, as the baseline, for all
outputs in the group. However, it can lead to inaccurate advantage estimates in
environments with highly noisy rewards, potentially introducing bias. In this
work, we propose a model, called Kalman Filter Enhanced Group Relative Policy
Optimization (KRPO), by using lightweight Kalman filtering to dynamically
estimate the latent reward mean and variance. This filtering technique replaces
the naive batch mean baseline, enabling more adaptive advantage normalization.
Our method does not require additional learned parameters over GRPO. This
approach offers a simple yet effective way to incorporate multiple outputs of
GRPO into advantage estimation, improving policy optimization in settings where
highly dynamic reward signals are difficult to model for language models.
Through experiments and analyses, we show that using a more adaptive advantage
estimation model, KRPO can improve the stability and performance of GRPO. The

Conclusion: NOCDDA通过噪声优化和类感知策略有效提升跨域对齐性能，具有鲁棒性和高效性。

Abstract: Pseudo-labeling is a cornerstone of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), yet
the scarcity of High-Confidence Pseudo-Labeled Target Domain Samples
(\textbf{hcpl-tds}) often leads to inaccurate cross-domain statistical
alignment, causing DA failures. To address this challenge, we propose
\textbf{N}oise \textbf{O}ptimized \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{D}iffusion for
\textbf{D}omain \textbf{A}daptation (\textbf{NOCDDA}), which seamlessly
integrates the generative capabilities of conditional diffusion models with the
decision-making requirements of DA to achieve task-coupled optimization for
efficient adaptation. For robust cross-domain consistency, we modify the DA
classifier to align with the conditional diffusion classifier within a unified
optimization framework, enabling forward training on noise-varying cross-domain
samples. Furthermore, we argue that the conventional \( \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},
\mathbf{I}) \) initialization in diffusion models often generates
class-confused hcpl-tds, compromising discriminative DA. To resolve this, we
introduce a class-aware noise optimization strategy that refines sampling
regions for reverse class-specific hcpl-tds generation, effectively enhancing
cross-domain alignment. Extensive experiments across 5 benchmark datasets and
29 DA tasks demonstrate significant performance gains of \textbf{NOCDDA} over
31 state-of-the-art methods, validating its robustness and effectiveness.

Conclusion: 该方法具有模型无关性、资源高效性，并能与任何LLM兼容，为知识图谱与LLM的整合提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Integrating structured knowledge from Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into Large
Language Models (LLMs) remains a key challenge for symbolic reasoning. Existing
methods mainly rely on prompt engineering or fine-tuning, which lose structural
fidelity or incur high computational costs. Building on recent encoding
techniques which integrate graph embeddings within the LLM input as tokens, we
extend this paradigm to the KG domain by leveraging Knowledge Graph Embedding
(KGE) models, thus enabling graph-aware reasoning. Our approach is
model-agnostic, resource-efficient, and compatible with any LLMs. Extensive
experimentation on synthetic and real-world datasets shows that our method
improves reasoning performance over established baselines, further achieving
the best trade-off in terms of accuracy and efficiency against state-of-the-art
LLMs.

Result: 理论证明算法收敛于平稳点邻域，实验验证了其在合成和真实数据集上的有效性。

Conclusion: KARULA能有效处理复杂客户端关系，优于聚类方法。

Abstract: One of the defining challenges in federated learning is that of statistical
heterogeneity among clients. We address this problem with KARULA, a regularized
strategy for personalized federated learning, which constrains the pairwise
model dissimilarities between clients based on the difference in their
distributions, as measured by a surrogate for the 1-Wasserstein distance
adapted for the federated setting. This allows the strategy to adapt to highly
complex interrelations between clients, that e.g., clustered approaches fail to
capture. We propose an inexact projected stochastic gradient algorithm to solve
the constrained problem that the strategy defines, and show theoretically that
it converges with smooth, possibly non-convex losses to a neighborhood of a
stationary point with rate O(1/K). We demonstrate the effectiveness of KARULA
on synthetic and real federated data sets.

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have improved performance while also
increasing computational demands. While federated and distributed setups
address these issues, their structure is vulnerable to malicious influences. In
this paper, we address a specific threat, Byzantine attacks, where compromised
clients inject adversarial updates to derail global convergence. We combine the
trust scores concept with trial function methodology to dynamically filter
outliers. Our methods address the critical limitations of previous approaches,
allowing functionality even when Byzantine nodes are in the majority. Moreover,
our algorithms adapt to widely used scaled methods like Adam and RMSProp, as
well as practical scenarios, including local training and partial
participation. We validate the robustness of our methods by conducting
extensive experiments on both synthetic and real ECG data collected from
medical institutions. Furthermore, we provide a broad theoretical analysis of
our algorithms and their extensions to aforementioned practical setups. The
convergence guarantees of our methods are comparable to those of classical
algorithms developed without Byzantine interference.

Motivation: 传统MLP在处理复杂数据集时难以高效捕捉非线性关系，而KANs基于Kolmogorov-Arnold定理，有望解决这一问题。

Method: 在联邦学习框架下比较KANs和MLPs的性能，实验覆盖四个数据集，评估不同参数聚合策略。

Result: KANs在准确性、稳定性和收敛效率上均优于MLPs，且在非IID数据下表现稳健，通信轮次更少。

Conclusion: KANs是联邦学习中MLPs的强有力替代方案，适用于去中心化和隐私保护场景。

Abstract: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), as a simple yet powerful model, continues to be
widely used in classification and regression tasks. However, traditional MLPs
often struggle to efficiently capture nonlinear relationships in load data when
dealing with complex datasets. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), inspired by
the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, have shown promising capabilities
in modeling complex nonlinear relationships. In this study, we explore the
performance of KANs within federated learning (FL) frameworks and compare them
to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons. Our experiments, conducted across four
diverse datasets demonstrate that KANs consistently outperform MLPs in terms of
accuracy, stability, and convergence efficiency. KANs exhibit remarkable
robustness under varying client numbers and non-IID data distributions,
maintaining superior performance even as client heterogeneity increases.
Notably, KANs require fewer communication rounds to converge compared to MLPs,
highlighting their efficiency in FL scenarios. Additionally, we evaluate
multiple parameter aggregation strategies, with trimmed mean and FedProx
emerging as the most effective for optimizing KAN performance. These findings
establish KANs as a robust and scalable alternative to MLPs for federated
learning tasks, paving the way for their application in decentralized and
privacy-preserving environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN解释方法通常仅优化单一可解释性指标（如保真度或简洁性），导致解释不够全面。本文旨在通过同时优化多个指标，提供更全面的解释。

Method: 提出skyline解释范式，将解释生成建模为多目标优化问题，并设计高效算法（如洋葱剥离法）逐步优化子图解释，同时保证质量。

Result: 在真实图数据上验证了算法的有效性、高效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: skyline解释方法能够生成更全面的GNN解释，优于单一指标优化的方法。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to generate subgraph explanations for
graph neural networks GNNs that simultaneously optimize multiple measures for
explainability. Existing GNN explanation methods often compute subgraphs
(called ``explanatory subgraphs'') that optimize a pre-defined, single
explainability measure, such as fidelity or conciseness. This can lead to
biased explanations that cannot provide a comprehensive explanation to clarify
the output of GNN models. We introduce skyline explanation, a GNN explanation
paradigm that aims to identify k explanatory subgraphs by simultaneously
optimizing multiple explainability measures. (1) We formulate skyline
explanation generation as a multi-objective optimization problem, and pursue
explanations that approximate a skyline set of explanatory subgraphs. We show
the hardness for skyline explanation generation. (2) We design efficient
algorithms with an onion-peeling approach that strategically removes edges from
neighbors of nodes of interests, and incrementally improves explanations as it
explores an interpretation domain, with provable quality guarantees. (3) We
further develop an algorithm to diversify explanations to provide more
comprehensive perspectives. Using real-world graphs, we empirically verify the
effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of our algorithms.

Abstract: This study focuses on the challenge of predicting network traffic within
complex topological environments. It introduces a spatiotemporal modeling
approach that integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) with Gated
Recurrent Units (GRU). The GCN component captures spatial dependencies among
network nodes, while the GRU component models the temporal evolution of traffic
data. This combination allows for precise forecasting of future traffic
patterns. The effectiveness of the proposed model is validated through
comprehensive experiments on the real-world Abilene network traffic dataset.
The model is benchmarked against several popular deep learning methods.
Furthermore, a set of ablation experiments is conducted to examine the
influence of various components on performance, including changes in the number
of graph convolution layers, different temporal modeling strategies, and
methods for constructing the adjacency matrix. Results indicate that the
proposed approach achieves superior performance across multiple metrics,
demonstrating robust stability and strong generalization capabilities in
complex network traffic forecasting scenarios.

Result: DHO在多个领域和细粒度数据集上表现优于基线，在ImageNet上以更少参数实现SOTA性能。

Conclusion: DHO通过双头优化有效解决了梯度冲突问题，提升了半监督知识蒸馏的效果。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
tasks by leveraging rich textual information with minimal labeled data.
However, deploying such large models remains challenging, particularly in
resource-constrained environments. Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a
well-established solution to this problem; however, recent KD approaches from
VLMs often involve multi-stage training or additional tuning, increasing
computational overhead and optimization complexity. In this paper, we propose
$\mathbf{\texttt{D}}$ual-$\mathbf{\texttt{H}}$ead
$\mathbf{\texttt{O}}$ptimization ($\mathbf{\texttt{DHO}}$) -- a simple yet
effective KD framework that transfers knowledge from VLMs to compact,
task-specific models in semi-supervised settings. Specifically, we introduce
dual prediction heads that independently learn from labeled data and teacher
predictions, and propose to linearly combine their outputs during inference. We
observe that $\texttt{DHO}$ mitigates gradient conflicts between supervised and
distillation signals, enabling more effective feature learning than single-head
KD baselines. As a result, extensive experiments show that $\texttt{DHO}$
consistently outperforms baselines across multiple domains and fine-grained
datasets. Notably, on ImageNet, it achieves state-of-the-art performance,
improving accuracy by 3% and 0.1% with 1% and 10% labeled data, respectively,
while using fewer parameters.

Result: 实验初步验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: \systemname{}通过动态优化推理路径，显著提升了LLM推理的效率和适应性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present a critical trade-off between inference
quality and computational cost: larger models offer superior capabilities but
incur significant latency, while smaller models are faster but less powerful.
Existing serving strategies often employ fixed model scales or static two-stage
speculative decoding, failing to dynamically adapt to the varying complexities
of user requests or fluctuations in system performance. This paper introduces
\systemname{}, a novel framework that reimagines LLM inference as an adaptive
routing problem solved through multi-level speculative decoding. \systemname{}
dynamically constructs and optimizes inference "paths" (chains of models) based
on real-time feedback, addressing the limitations of static approaches. Our
contributions are threefold: (1) An \textbf{adaptive model chain scheduling}
mechanism that leverages performance profiling (execution times) and predictive
similarity metrics (derived from token distribution divergence) to continuously
select the optimal sequence of draft and verifier models, minimizing predicted
latency per generated token. (2) A \textbf{multi-level collaborative
verification} framework where intermediate models within the selected chain can
validate speculative tokens, reducing the verification burden on the final,
most powerful target model. (3) A \textbf{synchronized state management} system
providing efficient, consistent KV cache handling across heterogeneous models
in the chain, including precise, low-overhead rollbacks tailored for
asynchronous batch processing inherent in multi-level speculation. Preliminary
experiments demonstrate the validity of our method.

Motivation: TCGA的多模态数据（包括病理报告文本）在癌症研究中未被充分利用，基础模型（FMs）为特征提取提供了新思路。

Result: 多模态融合模型优于单模态模型，病理报告文本的加入显著提升了预测性能。

Conclusion: 通过FMs和病理报告文本的信息提取，现代化了生存预测建模方法。

Abstract: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has enabled novel discoveries and served as a
large-scale reference through its harmonized genomics, clinical, and image
data. Prior studies have trained bespoke cancer survival prediction models from
unimodal or multimodal TCGA data. A modern paradigm in biomedical deep learning
is the development of foundation models (FMs) to derive meaningful feature
embeddings, agnostic to a specific modeling task. Biomedical text especially
has seen growing development of FMs. While TCGA contains free-text data as
pathology reports, these have been historically underutilized. Here, we
investigate the feasibility of training classical, multimodal survival models
over zero-shot embeddings extracted by FMs. We show the ease and additive
effect of multimodal fusion, outperforming unimodal models. We demonstrate the
benefit of including pathology report text and rigorously evaluate the effect
of model-based text summarization and hallucination. Overall, we modernize
survival modeling by leveraging FMs and information extraction from pathology
reports.

Result: 在人工数据集上优于七种现有方法，并在1,989名2型糖尿病患者数据中成功聚类，显示出清晰的临床特征。

Conclusion: 4TaStiC算法在医疗领域具有实用价值，并可推广至其他领域。

Abstract: Diabetes is one of the most prevalent diseases worldwide, characterized by
persistently high blood sugar levels, capable of damaging various internal
organs and systems. Diabetes patients require routine check-ups, resulting in a
time series of laboratory records, such as hemoglobin A1c, which reflects each
patient's health behavior over time and informs their doctor's recommendations.
Clustering patients into groups based on their entire time series data assists
doctors in making recommendations and choosing treatments without the need to
review all records. However, time series clustering of this type of dataset
introduces some challenges; patients visit their doctors at different time
points, making it difficult to capture and match trends, peaks, and patterns.
Additionally, two aspects must be considered: differences in the levels of
laboratory results and differences in trends and patterns. To address these
challenges, we introduce a new clustering algorithm called Time and Trend
Traveling Time Series Clustering (4TaStiC), using a base dissimilarity measure
combined with Euclidean and Pearson correlation metrics. We evaluated this
algorithm on artificial datasets, comparing its performance with that of seven
existing methods. The results show that 4TaStiC outperformed the other methods
on the targeted datasets. Finally, we applied 4TaStiC to cluster a cohort of
1,989 type 2 diabetes patients at Siriraj Hospital. Each group of patients
exhibits clear characteristics that will benefit doctors in making efficient
clinical decisions. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can be applied to
contexts outside the medical field.

Abstract: Large Language Models are versatile, general-purpose tools with a wide range
of applications. Recently, the advent of "reasoning models" has led to
substantial improvements in their abilities in advanced problem-solving domains
such as mathematics and software engineering. In this work, we assessed the
ability of reasoning models to directly perform chemistry tasks, without any
assistance from external tools. We created a novel benchmark, called ChemIQ,
which consists of 796 questions assessing core concepts in organic chemistry,
focused on molecular comprehension and chemical reasoning. Unlike previous
benchmarks, which primarily use multiple choice formats, our approach requires
models to construct short-answer responses, more closely reflecting real-world
applications. The reasoning models, exemplified by OpenAI's o3-mini, correctly
answered 28%-59% of questions depending on the reasoning level used, with
higher reasoning levels significantly increasing performance on all tasks.
These models substantially outperformed the non-reasoning model, GPT-4o, which
achieved only 7% accuracy. We found that Large Language Models can now convert
SMILES strings to IUPAC names, a task earlier models were unable to perform.
Additionally, we show that the latest reasoning models can elucidate structures
from 1H and 13C NMR data, correctly generating SMILES strings for 74% of
molecules containing up to 10 heavy atoms, and in one case solving a structure
comprising 21 heavy atoms. For each task, we found evidence that the reasoning
process mirrors that of a human chemist. Our results demonstrate that the
latest reasoning models have the ability to perform advanced chemical
reasoning.

Abstract: Algorithm selection, aiming to identify the best algorithm for a given
problem, plays a pivotal role in continuous black-box optimization. A common
approach involves representing optimization functions using a set of features,
which are then used to train a machine learning meta-model for selecting
suitable algorithms. Various approaches have demonstrated the effectiveness of
these algorithm selection meta-models. However, not all evaluation approaches
are equally valid for assessing the performance of meta-models. We highlight
methodological issues that frequently occur in the community and should be
addressed when evaluating algorithm selection approaches. First, we identify
flaws with the "leave-instance-out" evaluation technique. We show that
non-informative features and meta-models can achieve high accuracy, which
should not be the case with a well-designed evaluation framework. Second, we
demonstrate that measuring the performance of optimization algorithms with
metrics sensitive to the scale of the objective function requires careful
consideration of how this impacts the construction of the meta-model, its
predictions, and the model's error. Such metrics can falsely present overly
optimistic performance assessments of the meta-models. This paper emphasizes
the importance of careful evaluation, as loosely defined methodologies can
mislead researchers, divert efforts, and introduce noise into the field

Abstract: Obtaining real-world network datasets is often challenging because of
privacy, security, and computational constraints. In the absence of such
datasets, graph generative models become essential tools for creating synthetic
datasets. In this paper, we introduce a novel machine learning model for
generating high-fidelity synthetic network flow datasets that are
representative of real-world networks. Our approach involves the generation of
dynamic multigraphs using a stochastic Kronecker graph generator for structure
generation and a tabular generative adversarial network for feature generation.
We further employ an XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) model for graph
alignment, ensuring accurate overlay of features onto the generated graph
structure. We evaluate our model using new metrics that assess both the
accuracy and diversity of the synthetic graphs. Our results demonstrate
improvements in accuracy over previous large-scale graph generation methods
while maintaining similar efficiency. We also explore the trade-off between
accuracy and diversity in synthetic graph dataset creation, a topic not
extensively covered in related works. Our contributions include the synthesis
and evaluation of large real-world netflow datasets and the definition of new
metrics for evaluating synthetic graph generative models.

Abstract: We introduce MLE-Dojo, a Gym-style framework for systematically reinforcement
learning, evaluating, and improving autonomous large language model (LLM)
agents in iterative machine learning engineering (MLE) workflows. Unlike
existing benchmarks that primarily rely on static datasets or single-attempt
evaluations, MLE-Dojo provides an interactive environment enabling agents to
iteratively experiment, debug, and refine solutions through structured feedback
loops. Built upon 200+ real-world Kaggle challenges, MLE-Dojo covers diverse,
open-ended MLE tasks carefully curated to reflect realistic engineering
scenarios such as data processing, architecture search, hyperparameter tuning,
and code debugging. Its fully executable environment supports comprehensive
agent training via both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning,
facilitating iterative experimentation, realistic data sampling, and real-time
outcome verification. Extensive evaluations of eight frontier LLMs reveal that
while current models achieve meaningful iterative improvements, they still
exhibit significant limitations in autonomously generating long-horizon
solutions and efficiently resolving complex errors. Furthermore, MLE-Dojo's
flexible and extensible architecture seamlessly integrates diverse data
sources, tools, and evaluation protocols, uniquely enabling model-based agent
tuning and promoting interoperability, scalability, and reproducibility. We
open-source our framework and benchmarks to foster community-driven innovation
towards next-generation MLE agents.

Abstract: Currently, the scaling law of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces challenges
and bottlenecks. This paper posits that noise effects, stemming from changes in
the signal-to-noise ratio under diminishing marginal returns, are the root
cause of these issues. To control this noise, we investigated the differences
between models with performance advantages and disadvantages, introducing the
concept of "relative overfitting." Based on their complementary strengths, we
have proposed an application framework, Accept-Reject (AR). In Natural Language
Processing (NLP), we use LLMs and Small Language Models (SLMs) as the medium
for discussion. This framework enables SLMs to exert a universal positive
influence on LLM decision outputs, rather than the intuitively expected
negative influence. We validated our approach using self-built models based on
mainstream architectures and pre-trained mainstream models across multiple
datasets, including basic language modeling, long-context tasks, subject
examination, and question-answering (QA) benchmarks. The results demonstrate
that through our structure, compared to increasing the LLM's parameters, we can
achieve better performance improvements with significantly lower parameter and
computational costs in many scenarios. These improvements are universal,
stable, and effective. Furthermore, we explore the potential of "relative
overfitting" and the AR framework in other machine learning domains, such as
computer vision (CV) and AI for science. We hope the proposed approach can help
scale laws overcome existing bottlenecks.

Main category: cs.LG

TLDR: 研究发现，尽管长上下文模型经过训练，但其对长上下文的利用仍不足。通过基于块的推理方法，可以显著提升性能，甚至在某些任务中优于等效规模的Transformer。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型长上下文模型中固定大小循环内存对性能的影响，并寻找提升其效率的方法。

Method: 采用基于块的推理方法，仅处理输入中最相关的部分，以缓解循环内存的不足。

Result: 在LongBench基准测试中，性能显著提升（最高达51%），并在LongBench v2中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 循环模型可能未充分利用长距离依赖关系，而简单的单块策略在某些任务中表现更优。

Abstract: A recent trend in LLMs is developing recurrent sub-quadratic models that
improve long-context processing efficiency. We investigate leading large
long-context models, focusing on how their fixed-size recurrent memory affects
their performance. Our experiments reveal that, even when these models are
trained for extended contexts, their use of long contexts remains
underutilized. Specifically, we demonstrate that a chunk-based inference
procedure, which identifies and processes only the most relevant portion of the
input can mitigate recurrent memory failures and be effective for many
long-context tasks: On LongBench, our method improves the overall performance
of Falcon3-Mamba-Inst-7B by 14%, Falcon-Mamba-Inst-7B by 28%,
RecurrentGemma-IT-9B by 50%, and RWKV6-Finch-7B by 51%. Surprisingly, this
simple approach also leads to state-of-the-art results in the challenging
LongBench v2 benchmark, showing competitive performance with equivalent size
Transformers. Furthermore, our findings raise questions about whether recurrent
models genuinely exploit long-range dependencies, as our single-chunk strategy
delivers stronger performance - even in tasks that presumably require
cross-context relations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习决策缺乏透明度，限制了其在安全关键场景中的应用，需要提升可解释性以增强人类信任。

Method: 将状态特征视为合作玩家，应用Shapley值量化其对行为、性能和值估计的贡献。

Result: 框架提供数学基础明确的解释，与人类直觉一致并揭示新见解，统一并扩展了现有工作。

Conclusion: 为更可解释和可信的强化学习提供了理论基础，明确了现有方法的假设。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning agents can achieve superhuman performance, but their
decisions are often difficult to interpret. This lack of transparency limits
deployment, especially in safety-critical settings where human trust and
accountability are essential. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework
for explaining reinforcement learning through the influence of state features,
which represent what the agent observes in its environment. We identify three
core elements of the agent-environment interaction that benefit from
explanation: behaviour (what the agent does), performance (what the agent
achieves), and value estimation (what the agent expects to achieve). We treat
state features as players cooperating to produce each element and apply Shapley
values, a principled method from cooperative game theory, to identify the
influence of each feature. This approach yields a family of mathematically
grounded explanations with clear semantics and theoretical guarantees. We use
illustrative examples to show how these explanations align with human intuition
and reveal novel insights. Our framework unifies and extends prior work, making
explicit the assumptions behind existing approaches, and offers a principled
foundation for more interpretable and trustworthy reinforcement learning.

Main category: cs.CL

TLDR: ScaleMCP是一种新型工具选择方法，通过动态集成MCP工具检索器和自动同步存储系统，提升LLM代理的工具选择能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具选择框架未集成MCP服务器，依赖手动更新，导致低效和不一致，且限制代理自主性。

Method: 引入ScaleMCP，结合MCP工具检索器和自动同步存储系统，提出TDWA嵌入策略优化工具文档嵌入。

Result: 在5000个金融指标MCP服务器上的评估显示，工具检索和代理调用性能显著提升。

Conclusion: ScaleMCP在动态工具选择和调用中表现出高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and the introduction of
the Model Context Protocol (MCP) have significantly expanded LLM agents'
capability to interact dynamically with external tools and APIs. However,
existing tool selection frameworks do not integrate MCP servers, instead
relying heavily on error-prone manual updates to monolithic local tool
repositories, leading to duplication, inconsistencies, and inefficiencies.
Additionally, current approaches abstract tool selection before the LLM agent
is invoked, limiting its autonomy and hindering dynamic re-querying
capabilities during multi-turn interactions. To address these issues, we
introduce ScaleMCP, a novel tool selection approach that dynamically equips LLM
agents with a MCP tool retriever, giving agents the autonomy to add tools into
their memory, as well as an auto-synchronizing tool storage system pipeline
through CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations with MCP servers as the
single source of truth. We also propose a novel embedding strategy, Tool
Document Weighted Average (TDWA), designed to selectively emphasize critical
components of tool documents (e.g. tool name or synthetic questions) during the
embedding process. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on a created dataset of
5,000 financial metric MCP servers, across 10 LLM models, 5 embedding models,
and 5 retriever types, demonstrate substantial improvements in tool retrieval
and agent invocation performance, emphasizing ScaleMCP's effectiveness in
scalable, dynamic tool selection and invocation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准仅关注答案准确性，忽略了教育场景中教学能力的重要性。

Method: 使用教育评分标准和模拟学生模型评估MLLMs，通过偏好优化方法微调模型。

Result: 优化后的模型在教学能力上表现更优，且问题解决能力与教学能力不完全相关。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建兼具问题解决和教学能力的MLLMs提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive performance
on scientific reasoning tasks (e.g., ScienceQA). However, most existing
benchmarks focus narrowly on the accuracy of the final answer while ignoring
other metrics. In particular, when applying MLLMs to educational contexts, the
goal is not only correctness but also the ability to teach. In this paper, we
propose a framework that evaluates MLLMs as science tutors using a
comprehensive educational rubric and a simulated student model that judges the
teaching performance of the tutors. Given a list of candidate MLLM science
tutors, we use rubric-based student judgments to produce a range of tutor
performance scores, identifying both strong and weak tutors. Using the training
section of the ScienceQA dataset, we then construct a data set of pairwise
comparisons between the outputs of strong and weak tutors. This enables us to
apply multiple preference optimization methods to fine-tune an underperforming
tutor model (Qwen2-VL-2B) into more effective ones. Our results also show that
strong problem-solving skills do not guarantee high-quality tutoring and that
performance optimization-guided refinements can yield more educationally
aligned tutor models. This approach opens avenues for building MLLMs that serve
not only as problem solvers, but as genuinely helpful educational assistants.

Conclusion: 利用模型内在推理能力检测不安全意图是解决MLRMs安全问题的潜在途径，研究为开发安全MLRMs提供了新视角。

Abstract: The rapid development of multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) has
demonstrated broad application potential, yet their safety and reliability
remain critical concerns that require systematic exploration. To address this
gap, we conduct a comprehensive and systematic safety evaluation of 11 MLRMs
across 5 benchmarks and unveil prevalent safety degradation phenomena in most
advanced models. Moreover, our analysis reveals distinct safety patterns across
different benchmarks: significant safety degradation is observed across
jailbreak robustness benchmarks, whereas safety-awareness benchmarks
demonstrate less pronounced degradation. In particular, a long thought process
in some scenarios even enhances safety performance. Therefore, it is a
potential approach to addressing safety issues in MLRMs by leveraging the
intrinsic reasoning capabilities of the model to detect unsafe intent. To
operationalize this insight, we construct a multimodal tuning dataset that
incorporates a safety-oriented thought process. Experimental results from
fine-tuning existing MLRMs with this dataset effectively enhances the safety on
both jailbreak robustness and safety-awareness benchmarks. This study provides
a new perspective for developing safe MLRMs. Our dataset is available at

Conclusion: 开源小型LLM结合半自动化框架和RL能高效生成指令数据，降低成本并提升性能。

Abstract: Instruction-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven effective in
numerous few-shot or zero-shot Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
However, creating human-annotated instruction data is time-consuming,
expensive, and often limited in quantity and task diversity. Previous research
endeavors have attempted to address this challenge by proposing frameworks
capable of generating instructions in a semi-automated and task-agnostic manner
directly from the model itself. Many of these efforts have relied on large
API-only parameter-based models such as GPT-3.5 (175B), which are expensive,
and subject to limits on a number of queries. This paper explores the
performance of three open-source small LLMs such as LLaMA 2-7B, LLama 2-13B,
and Mistral 7B, using a semi-automated framework, thereby reducing human
intervention, effort, and cost required to generate an instruction dataset for
fine-tuning LLMs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that incorporating a
Reinforcement Learning (RL) based training algorithm into this LLMs-based
framework leads to further enhancements. Our evaluation of the dataset reveals
that these RL-based frameworks achieve a substantial improvements in 63-66% of
the tasks compared to previous approaches.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖参考段落优化，但实际场景中难以获取，需解决这一问题。

Method: 采用响应推断和双重角色优化，生成伪参考段落并优化响应。

Result: DualReform达到96.9--99.1%的检索准确率，超越现有方法31.6%。

Conclusion: DualReform在无参考段落情况下仍能高效提升检索性能。

Abstract: Conversational query reformulation (CQR) has become indispensable for
improving retrieval in dialogue-based applications. However, existing
approaches typically rely on reference passages for optimization, which are
impractical to acquire in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we
introduce a novel reference-free preference optimization framework DualReform
that generates pseudo reference passages from commonly-encountered
conversational datasets containing only queries and responses. DualReform
attains this goal through two key innovations: (1) response-based inference,
where responses serve as proxies to infer pseudo reference passages, and (2)
response refinement via the dual-role of CQR, where a CQR model refines
responses based on the shared objectives between response refinement and CQR.
Despite not relying on reference passages, DualReform achieves 96.9--99.1% of
the retrieval accuracy attainable only with reference passages and surpasses
the state-of-the-art method by up to 31.6%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统存在检索不精确、上下文覆盖不完整和信息碎片化的问题。

Method: MacRAG通过将文档分层压缩和分区，并实时自适应合并相关上下文，构建查询特定的长上下文。

Result: 在LongBench扩展任务中，MacRAG优于基线RAG系统，支持单步和多步生成任务。

Conclusion: MacRAG为长上下文和多跳推理任务提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Long-context (LC) Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) hold strong potential for complex
multi-hop and large-document tasks. However, existing RAG systems often suffer
from imprecise retrieval, incomplete context coverage under constrained context
windows, and fragmented information caused by suboptimal context construction.
We introduce Multi-scale Adaptive Context RAG (MacRAG), a hierarchical
retrieval framework that compresses and partitions documents into
coarse-to-fine granularities, then adaptively merges relevant contexts through
chunk- and document-level expansions in real time. By starting from the
finest-level retrieval and progressively incorporating higher-level and broader
context, MacRAG constructs effective query-specific long contexts, optimizing
both precision and coverage. Evaluations on the challenging LongBench
expansions of HotpotQA, 2WikiMultihopQA, and Musique confirm that MacRAG
consistently surpasses baseline RAG pipelines on single- and multi-step
generation with Llama-3.1-8B, Gemini-1.5-pro, and GPT-4o. Our results establish
MacRAG as an efficient, scalable solution for real-world long-context,
multi-hop reasoning. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多模态摘要任务中更高效，MFactSum为评估提供了新标准。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to balance visual and textual
information when summarizing complex multimodal inputs, such as entire TV show
episodes. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot video-to-text summarization
approach that builds its own screenplay representation of an episode,
effectively integrating key video moments, dialogue, and character information
into a unified document. Unlike previous approaches, we simultaneously generate
screenplays and name the characters in zero-shot, using only the audio, video,
and transcripts as input. Additionally, we highlight that existing
summarization metrics can fail to assess the multimodal content in summaries.
To address this, we introduce MFactSum, a multimodal metric that evaluates
summaries with respect to both vision and text modalities. Using MFactSum, we
evaluate our screenplay summaries on the SummScreen3D dataset, demonstrating
superiority against state-of-the-art VLMs such as Gemini 1.5 by generating
summaries containing 20% more relevant visual information while requiring 75%
less of the video as input.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于波斯语，还可扩展至其他具有丰富同形异义现象的语言（如中文和阿拉伯语），为低资源语言处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion for Persian presents unique challenges
due to its complex phonological features, particularly homographs and Ezafe,
which exist in formal and informal language contexts. This paper introduces an
intermediate language specifically designed for Persian language processing
that addresses these challenges through a multi-faceted approach. Our
methodology combines two key components: Large Language Model (LLM) prompting
techniques and a specialized sequence-to-sequence machine transliteration
architecture. We developed and implemented a systematic approach for
constructing a comprehensive lexical database for homographs with multiple
pronunciations disambiguation often termed polyphones, utilizing formal concept
analysis for semantic differentiation. We train our model using two distinct
datasets: the LLM-generated dataset for formal and informal Persian and the
B-Plus podcasts for informal language variants. The experimental results
demonstrate superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
approaches, particularly in handling the complexities of Persian phoneme
conversion. Our model significantly improves Phoneme Error Rate (PER) metrics,
establishing a new benchmark for Persian G2P conversion accuracy. This work
contributes to the growing research in low-resource language processing and
provides a robust solution for Persian text-to-speech systems and demonstrating
its applicability beyond Persian. Specifically, the approach can extend to
languages with rich homographic phenomena such as Chinese and Arabic

Abstract: Modeling semantic relevance has always been a challenging and critical task
in natural language processing. In recent years, with the emergence of massive
amounts of annotated data, it has become feasible to train complex models, such
as neural network-based reasoning models. These models have shown excellent
performance in practical applications and have achieved the current
state-ofthe-art performance. However, even with such large-scale annotated
data, we still need to think: Can machines learn all the knowledge necessary to
perform semantic relevance detection tasks based on this data alone? If not,
how can neural network-based models incorporate external knowledge into
themselves, and how can relevance detection models be constructed to make full
use of external knowledge? In this paper, we use external knowledge to enhance
the pre-trained semantic relevance discrimination model. Experimental results
on 10 public datasets show that our method achieves consistent improvements in
performance compared to the baseline model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖预训练语言模型的最后一层输出，可能忽略了中间层的有价值信息，限制了复杂语义关系的建模能力。

Method: CIRN采用分层特征提取策略，在交互空间中逐步整合跨句子信息，实现从表层特征匹配到深层逻辑语义连接的渐进推理。

Result: 在多个标准NLI数据集上的评估表明，CIRN性能优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CIRN通过利用多层次交互特征，有效提升了复杂关系推理的能力。

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) focuses on ascertaining the logical
relationship (entailment, contradiction, or neutral) between a given premise
and hypothesis. This task presents significant challenges due to inherent
linguistic features such as diverse phrasing, semantic complexity, and
contextual nuances. While Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) built upon the
Transformer architecture have yielded substantial advancements in NLI,
prevailing methods predominantly utilize representations from the terminal
layer. This reliance on final-layer outputs may overlook valuable information
encoded in intermediate layers, potentially limiting the capacity to model
intricate semantic interactions effectively. Addressing this gap, we introduce
the Cascaded Interactive Reasoning Network (CIRN), a novel architecture
designed for deeper semantic comprehension in NLI. CIRN implements a
hierarchical feature extraction strategy across multiple network depths,
operating within an interactive space where cross-sentence information is
continuously integrated. This mechanism aims to mimic a process of progressive
reasoning, transitioning from surface-level feature matching to uncovering more
profound logical and semantic connections between the premise and hypothesis.
By systematically mining latent semantic relationships at various
representational levels, CIRN facilitates a more thorough understanding of the
input pair. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on several standard NLI
benchmark datasets reveal consistent performance gains achieved by CIRN over
competitive baseline approaches, demonstrating the efficacy of leveraging
multi-level interactive features for complex relational reasoning.

architecture of Meta Pseudo Labels in which a ''teacher'' generates labels for
originally unlabeled training data to train the ''student'' and updates its own
model iteratively based on the performance of the student on the gold-labeled
portion of the data. We extend the original model of Hatefi et al. by an
unsupervised pre-training phase based on objective masking, and conduct
in-depth performance evaluations of the original model, our extension, and

Abstract: Multi-domain sentiment classification aims to mitigate poor performance

because domain classification helps generate necessary information for
sentiment classification. Intuitively, the importance of sentiment
classification tasks is the same in all domains for multi-domain sentiment
classification; but domain classification tasks are different because the
impact of domain information on sentiment classification varies across
different fields; this can be controlled through adjustable weights or hyper
parameters. However, as the number of domains increases, existing
hyperparameter optimization algorithms may face the following challenges: (1)
tremendous demand for computing resources, (2) convergence problems, and (3)
high algorithm complexity. To efficiently generate the domain information
required for sentiment classification in each domain, we propose a dynamic
information modulation algorithm. Specifically, the model training process is
divided into two stages. In the first stage, a shared hyperparameter, which
would control the proportion of domain classification tasks across all fields,
is determined. In the second stage, we introduce a novel domain-aware
modulation algorithm to adjust the domain information contained in the input
text, which is then calculated based on a gradient-based and loss-based method.
In summary, experimental results on a public sentiment analysis dataset
containing 16 domains prove the superiority of the proposed method.

TLDR: 本文研究了仅解码器Transformer网络中FFN的重要性，发现三层的FFN配置比标准的两层配置性能更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨FFN在模型预训练过程中的重要性。

Method: 通过实验比较不同FFN配置（两层与三层）的性能。

Result: 三层的FFN配置在更少的参数和时间内实现了更低的训练损失。

Conclusion: FFN对模型性能至关重要，且三层FFN配置优于标准的两层配置。

Abstract: Decoder-only transformer networks have become incredibly popular for language
modeling tasks. State-of-the-art models can have over a hundred transformer
blocks, containing billions of trainable parameters, and are trained on
trillions of tokens of text. Each transformer block typically consists of a
multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism and a two-layer fully connected
feedforward network (FFN). In this paper, we examine the importance of the FFN
during the model pre-training process through a series of experiments,
confirming that the FFN is important to model performance. Furthermore, we show
that models using a transformer block configuration with three-layer FFNs with
fewer such blocks outperform the standard two-layer configuration delivering
lower training loss with fewer total parameters in less time.

TLDR: TS-SUPERB是一个针对目标说话人在嘈杂多说话人条件下的语音处理基准测试，填补了现有SSL模型评测的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SSL模型评测主要关注单说话人场景，缺乏对更复杂但实用的目标说话人任务的评估。

Method: 引入TS-SUPERB基准，包含四项目标说话人处理任务，使用说话人嵌入作为线索，并采用统一的SSL目标语音编码器进行联合优化。

Result: 结果显示，目标说话人场景下的性能无法直接从单说话人任务推断，联合优化能有效利用任务间的互信息。

Conclusion: TS-SUPERB强调了在目标说话人场景中评估SSL模型的重要性，并展示了联合优化的潜力。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) models have significantly advanced speech
processing tasks, and several benchmarks have been proposed to validate their
effectiveness. However, previous benchmarks have primarily focused on
single-speaker scenarios, with less exploration of target-speaker tasks in
noisy, multi-talker conditions -- a more challenging yet practical case. In
this paper, we introduce the Target-Speaker Speech Processing Universal
Performance Benchmark (TS-SUPERB), which includes four widely recognized
target-speaker processing tasks that require identifying the target speaker and
extracting information from the speech mixture. In our benchmark, the speaker
embedding extracted from enrollment speech is used as a clue to condition
downstream models. The benchmark result reveals the importance of evaluating
SSL models in target speaker scenarios, demonstrating that performance cannot
be easily inferred from related single-speaker tasks. Moreover, by using a
unified SSL-based target speech encoder, consisting of a speaker encoder and an
extractor module, we also investigate joint optimization across TS tasks to
leverage mutual information and demonstrate its effectiveness.

Motivation: 研究BERTopic中不同嵌入表示对主题建模性能的影响，以优化算法效果。

Method: 在三个数据集上评估18种嵌入表示，使用主题一致性和多样性作为性能指标。

Result: 发现某些嵌入配置优于BERTopic的默认设置，且停用词对不同配置有影响。

Conclusion: 通过优化嵌入配置，可以提升BERTopic的性能。

Abstract: BERTopic is a topic modeling algorithm that leverages transformer-based
embeddings to create dense clusters, enabling the estimation of topic
structures and the extraction of valuable insights from a corpus of documents.
This approach allows users to efficiently process large-scale text data and
gain meaningful insights into its structure. While BERTopic is a powerful tool,
embedding preparation can vary, including extracting representations from
intermediate model layers and applying transformations to these embeddings. In
this study, we evaluate 18 different embedding representations and present
findings based on experiments conducted on three diverse datasets. To assess
the algorithm's performance, we report topic coherence and topic diversity
metrics across all experiments. Our results demonstrate that, for each dataset,
it is possible to find an embedding configuration that performs better than the
default setting of BERTopic. Additionally, we investigate the influence of stop
words on different embedding configurations.

Conclusion: Feedbacker为LLM评估提供了更全面的反馈，支持模型优化和行为理解。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation benchmarks such as MT-Bench, Arena-Hard, and Auto-Arena
are seeing growing adoption for the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs).
Existing research has primarily focused on approximating human-based model
rankings using limited data and LLM-as-a-Judge. However, the fundamental
premise of these studies, which attempts to replicate human rankings, is
flawed. Specifically, these benchmarks typically offer only overall scores,
limiting their utility to leaderboard rankings, rather than providing feedback
that can guide model optimization and support model profiling. Therefore, we
advocate for an evaluation paradigm shift from approximating human-based model
rankings to providing feedback with analytical value. To this end, we introduce
Feedbacker, an evaluation framework that provides comprehensive and
fine-grained results, thereby enabling thorough identification of a model's
specific strengths and weaknesses. Such feedback not only supports the targeted
optimization of the model but also enhances the understanding of its behavior.
Feedbacker comprises three key components: an extensible tree-based query
taxonomy builder, an automated query synthesis scheme, and a suite of
visualization and analysis tools. Furthermore, we propose a novel
LLM-as-a-Judge method: PC2 (Pre-Comparison-derived Criteria) pointwise
evaluation. This method derives evaluation criteria by pre-comparing the
differences between several auxiliary responses, achieving the accuracy of
pairwise evaluation while maintaining the time complexity of pointwise
evaluation. Finally, leveraging the evaluation results of 17 mainstream LLMs,
we demonstrate the usage of Feedbacker and highlight its effectiveness and
potential. Our homepage project is available at

Motivation: 现有文献很少研究门控的具体效果，本文旨在系统研究门控增强的软注意力变体。

Method: 对30种15B MoE模型和1.7B密集模型进行实验，比较不同门控位置和计算变体。

Result: 头特定的Sigmoid门控能提升性能、训练稳定性，并改善长上下文外推能力。

Conclusion: 门控机制通过引入非线性和稀疏门控分数，有效优化软注意力机制。

Abstract: Gating mechanisms have been widely utilized, from early models like LSTMs and
Highway Networks to recent state space models, linear attention, and also
softmax attention. Yet, existing literature rarely examines the specific
effects of gating. In this work, we conduct comprehensive experiments to
systematically investigate gating-augmented softmax attention variants.
Specifically, we perform a comprehensive comparison over 30 variants of 15B
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models and 1.7B dense models trained on a 3.5 trillion
token dataset. Our central finding is that a simple modification-applying a
head-specific sigmoid gate after the Scaled Dot-Product Attention
(SDPA)-consistently improves performance. This modification also enhances
training stability, tolerates larger learning rates, and improves scaling
properties. By comparing various gating positions and computational variants,
we attribute this effectiveness to two key factors: (1) introducing
non-linearity upon the low-rank mapping in the softmax attention, and (2)
applying query-dependent sparse gating scores to modulate the SDPA output.
Notably, we find this sparse gating mechanism mitigates 'attention sink' and
enhances long-context extrapolation performance, and we also release related
$\href{https://github.com/qiuzh20/gated_attention}{codes}$ and
$\href{https://huggingface.co/QwQZh/gated_attention}{models}$ to facilitate

Motivation: 探讨两国基于相同证据却制定出截然不同的电子烟监管政策的原因。

Method: 使用GPT-4开发大型语言模型句子分类器，分析109份政策文件中的句子，分类为电子烟对公共健康有益或有害。

Result: 分类器F-score为0.9；澳大利亚文件更多强调危害，英国文件更多强调益处。

Conclusion: LLM方法揭示了政策文件对证据的不同侧重，为研究证据与健康政策关系提供了新工具。

Abstract: Australia and the UK have developed contrasting approaches to the regulation
of electronic cigarettes, with - broadly speaking - Australia adopting a
relatively restrictive approach and the UK adopting a more permissive approach.
Notably, these divergent policies were developed from the same broad evidence
base. In this paper, to investigate differences in how the two jurisdictions
manage and present evidence, we developed and evaluated a Large Language
Model-based sentence classifier to perform automated analyses of electronic
cigarette-related policy documents drawn from official Australian and UK
legislative processes (109 documents in total). Specifically, we utilized GPT-4
to automatically classify sentences based on whether they contained claims that
e-cigarettes were broadly helpful or harmful for public health. Our LLM-based
classifier achieved an F-score of 0.9. Further, when applying the classifier to
our entire sentence-level corpus, we found that Australian legislative
documents show a much higher proportion of harmful statements, and a lower
proportion of helpful statements compared to the expected values, with the
opposite holding for the UK. In conclusion, this work utilized an LLM-based
approach to provide evidence to support the contention that - drawing on the
same evidence base - Australian ENDS-related policy documents emphasize the
harms associated with ENDS products and UK policy documents emphasize the
benefits. Further, our approach provides a starting point for using LLM-based
methods to investigate the complex relationship between evidence and health
policy formation.

Motivation: BIGBIRD-PEGASUS模型在长文档摘要中表现优秀，但无法处理超过4096个token的超长文档。传统截断方法效果不佳，因此需要新方法。

Method: 通过微调预训练的BIGBIRD-PEGASUS模型，并筛选长度超过20,000个token的文档。为避免域偏移和小数据集过拟合，采用数据增强方法将文档-摘要对分割为多个部分以适应模型输入限制。

Result: 研究提出了一种新方法，有效解决了超长文档摘要的性能问题，并公开了源代码。

Conclusion: 通过微调和数据增强，BIGBIRD-PEGASUS模型能够更好地处理超长文档摘要任务。

Abstract: $\texttt{BIGBIRD-PEGASUS}$ model achieves $\textit{state-of-the-art}$ on
abstractive text summarization for long documents. However it's capacity still
limited to maximum of $4,096$ tokens, thus caused performance degradation on
summarization for very long documents. Common method to deal with the issue is
to truncate the documents. In this reasearch, we'll use different approach.
We'll use the pretrained $\texttt{BIGBIRD-PEGASUS}$ model by fine tuned the
model on other domain dataset. First, we filter out all documents which length
less than $20,000$ tokens to focus on very long documents. To prevent domain
shifting problem and overfitting on transfer learning due to small dataset, we
augment the dataset by splitting document-summary training pair into parts, to
fit the document into $4,096$ tokens. Source code available on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练语言模型在有限下游数据上微调时易受对抗攻击和过拟合的问题。

Method: 将BERT层视为ODE的解，分析数值稳定性并提出IM-connection策略。

Result: 在AdvGLUE数据集上，IM-BERT比原始BERT性能提升8.3%，低资源场景下提升5.9%。

Conclusion: IM-BERT通过动态系统方法显著提升了PLM的鲁棒性，尤其在低资源场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on
diverse NLP tasks through pre-training and fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning
the model with a large number of parameters on limited downstream datasets
often leads to vulnerability to adversarial attacks, causing overfitting of the
model on standard datasets.
  To address these issues, we propose IM-BERT from the perspective of a dynamic
system by conceptualizing a layer of BERT as a solution of Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs). Under the situation of initial value
perturbation, we analyze the numerical stability of two main numerical ODE
solvers: the explicit and implicit Euler approaches.
  Based on these analyses, we introduce a numerically robust IM-connection
incorporating BERT's layers. This strategy enhances the robustness of PLMs
against adversarial attacks, even in low-resource scenarios, without
introducing additional parameters or adversarial training strategies.
  Experimental results on the adversarial GLUE (AdvGLUE) dataset validate the
robustness of IM-BERT under various conditions. Compared to the original BERT,
IM-BERT exhibits a performance improvement of approximately 8.3\%p on the
AdvGLUE dataset. Furthermore, in low-resource scenarios, IM-BERT outperforms
BERT by achieving 5.9\%p higher accuracy.

Motivation: 解决大规模社交模拟中高时间和计算成本的问题，同时避免现有方法在准确性和通用性上的妥协。

Method: 分为两阶段：语言进化（过滤同义词并优化句子规则）和语言利用（代理使用进化后的语言进行通信）。

Result: 实验显示EcoLANG减少20%以上的标记消耗，提高效率且不影响模拟准确性。

Conclusion: EcoLANG为社交模拟提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated an impressive ability to
role-play humans and replicate complex social dynamics. While large-scale
social simulations are gaining increasing attention, they still face
significant challenges, particularly regarding high time and computation costs.
Existing solutions, such as distributed mechanisms or hybrid agent-based model
(ABM) integrations, either fail to address inference costs or compromise
accuracy and generalizability. To this end, we propose EcoLANG: Efficient and
Effective Agent Communication Language Induction for Social Simulation. EcoLANG
operates in two stages: (1) language evolution, where we filter synonymous
words and optimize sentence-level rules through natural selection, and (2)
language utilization, where agents in social simulations communicate using the
evolved language. Experimental results demonstrate that EcoLANG reduces token
consumption by over 20%, enhancing efficiency without sacrificing simulation
accuracy.

Result: 实验表明，使用硬干扰段落微调的LLM在回答准确率上提升了7.5%。

Conclusion: 论文为识别和利用硬干扰段落提供了全面框架，显著提升了RAG系统的性能。

Abstract: A well-known issue with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is that
retrieved passages that are irrelevant to the query sometimes distract the
answer-generating LLM, causing it to provide an incorrect response. In this
paper, we shed light on this core issue and formulate the distracting effect of
a passage w.r.t. a query (and an LLM). We provide a quantifiable measure of the
distracting effect of a passage and demonstrate its robustness across LLMs.
  Our research introduces novel methods for identifying and using hard
distracting passages to improve RAG systems. By fine-tuning LLMs with these
carefully selected distracting passages, we achieve up to a 7.5% increase in
answering accuracy compared to counterparts fine-tuned on conventional RAG
datasets. Our contribution is two-fold: first, we move beyond the simple binary
classification of irrelevant passages as either completely unrelated vs.
distracting, and second, we develop and analyze multiple methods for finding
hard distracting passages. To our knowledge, no other research has provided
such a comprehensive framework for identifying and utilizing hard distracting
passages.

Abstract: A cuneiform tablet KBo 23.1 ++/KUB 30.38, which is known to represent a text
of Kizzuwatna rituals, was written by two writers with almost identical content
in two iterations. Unlike other cuneiform tablets that contained information
such as myths, essays, or business records, the reason why ancient people left
such tablets for posterity remains unclear. To study this problem, we develop a
new methodology by analyzing images of a tablet quantitatively using CNN
(Convolutional Neural Network)-based image models, without segmenting
cuneiforms one-by-one. Our data-driven methodology implies that the writer
writing the first half was a `teacher' and the other writer was a `student' who
was training his skills of writing cuneiforms. This result has not been reached
by classical linguistics. We also discuss related conclusions and possible
further directions for applying our method and its generalizations.

Result: 在ESC数据集上，straQ*优于直接推理、自优化、思维链、微调和有限状态机等基线方法。

Conclusion: straQ*通过强化学习优化LLMs在ESC中的表现，显著提升了长期满意度。

Abstract: Emotional support conversation (ESC) aims to alleviate the emotional distress
of individuals through effective conversations. Although large language models
(LLMs) have obtained remarkable progress on ESC, most of these studies might
not define the diagram from the state model perspective, therefore providing a
suboptimal solution for long-term satisfaction. To address such an issue, we
leverage the Q-learning on LLMs, and propose a framework called straQ*. Our
framework allows a plug-and-play LLM to bootstrap the planning during ESC,
determine the optimal strategy based on long-term returns, and finally guide
the LLM to response. Substantial experiments on ESC datasets suggest that
straQ* outperforms many baselines, including direct inference, self-refine,
chain of thought, finetuning, and finite state machines.

Result: 在英法两种语言的医疗数据集上验证了HAMLET的有效性。

Conclusion: HAMLET通过图驱动架构显著提升了主题模型的连贯性和质量。

Abstract: Traditional topic models often struggle with contextual nuances and fail to
adequately handle polysemy and rare words. This limitation typically results in
topics that lack coherence and quality. Large Language Models (LLMs) can
mitigate this issue by generating an initial set of topics. However, these raw
topics frequently lack refinement and representativeness, which leads to
redundancy without lexical similarity and reduced interpretability. This paper
introduces HAMLET, a graph-driven architecture for cross-lingual healthcare
topic modeling that uses LLMs. The proposed approach leverages neural-enhanced
semantic fusion to refine the embeddings of topics generated by the LLM.
Instead of relying solely on statistical co-occurrence or human interpretation
to extract topics from a document corpus, this method introduces a topic
embedding refinement that uses Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN). After topic generation, a
hybrid technique that involves BERT and Sentence-BERT (SBERT) is employed for
embedding. The topic representations are further refined using a GNN, which
establishes connections between documents, topics, words, similar topics, and
similar words. A novel method is introduced to compute similarities.
Consequently, the topic embeddings are refined, and the top k topics are
extracted. Experiments were conducted using two healthcare datasets, one in
English and one in French, from which six sets were derived. The results
demonstrate the effectiveness of HAMLET.

Motivation: 数学教育中有效反馈需要全面分析课堂对话，但现有方法因多功能性和遗漏问题无法满足需求。

Method: 提出多视角话语分析框架，整合领域特定的对话动作（43标签）和话语关系（16关系），应用于两个数学教育数据集。

Result: 发现无对话动作的话语在引导、确认和结构化课堂对话中起关键作用，揭示了有意义的话语模式。

Conclusion: 结合话语关系和对话动作的框架可提升AI辅助教育系统的反馈能力，支持更灵活的学习环境。

Abstract: Effective feedback is essential for refining instructional practices in
mathematics education, and researchers often turn to advanced natural language
processing (NLP) models to analyze classroom dialogues from multiple
perspectives. However, utterance-level discourse analysis encounters two
primary challenges: (1) multifunctionality, where a single utterance may serve
multiple purposes that a single tag cannot capture, and (2) the exclusion of
many utterances from domain-specific discourse move classifications, leading to
their omission in feedback. To address these challenges, we proposed a
multi-perspective discourse analysis that integrates domain-specific talk moves
with dialogue act (using the flattened multi-functional SWBD-MASL schema with
43 tags) and discourse relation (applying Segmented Discourse Representation
Theory with 16 relations). Our top-down analysis framework enables a
comprehensive understanding of utterances that contain talk moves, as well as
utterances that do not contain talk moves. This is applied to two mathematics
education datasets: TalkMoves (teaching) and SAGA22 (tutoring). Through
distributional unigram analysis, sequential talk move analysis, and multi-view
deep dive, we discovered meaningful discourse patterns, and revealed the vital
role of utterances without talk moves, demonstrating that these utterances, far
from being mere fillers, serve crucial functions in guiding, acknowledging, and
structuring classroom discourse. These insights underscore the importance of
incorporating discourse relations and dialogue acts into AI-assisted education
systems to enhance feedback and create more responsive learning environments.
Our framework may prove helpful for providing human educator feedback, but also
aiding in the development of AI agents that can effectively emulate the roles
of both educators and students.

Motivation: 医疗文本数据量大且复杂，需要高效且准确的分类方法，同时需满足隐私保护要求（如HIPAA）。

Method: 结合知识蒸馏和序列微调，利用粒子群优化（PSO）进行超参数调优，将BERT的知识迁移到轻量级DistilBERT。

Conclusion: KDH-MLTC平衡了资源受限医疗环境下的效率需求与准确性，为医疗文本分类研究提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing volume of healthcare textual data requires computationally
efficient, yet highly accurate classification approaches able to handle the
nuanced and complex nature of medical terminology. This research presents
Knowledge Distillation for Healthcare Multi-Label Text Classification
(KDH-MLTC), a framework leveraging model compression and Large Language Models
(LLMs). The proposed approach addresses conventional healthcare Multi-Label
Text Classification (MLTC) challenges by integrating knowledge distillation and
sequential fine-tuning, subsequently optimized through Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO) for hyperparameter tuning. KDH-MLTC transfers knowledge from
a more complex teacher LLM (i.e., BERT) to a lighter student LLM (i.e.,
DistilBERT) through sequential training adapted to MLTC that preserves the
teacher's learned information while significantly reducing computational
requirements. As a result, the classification is enabled to be conducted
locally, making it suitable for healthcare textual data characterized by
sensitivity and, therefore, ensuring HIPAA compliance. The experiments
conducted on three medical literature datasets of different sizes, sampled from
the Hallmark of Cancer (HoC) dataset, demonstrate that KDH-MLTC achieves
superior performance compared to existing approaches, particularly for the
largest dataset, reaching an F1 score of 82.70%. Additionally, statistical
validation and an ablation study are carried out, proving the robustness of
KDH-MLTC. Furthermore, the PSO-based hyperparameter optimization process
allowed the identification of optimal configurations. The proposed approach
contributes to healthcare text classification research, balancing efficiency
requirements in resource-constrained healthcare settings with satisfactory

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在知识密集型领域（如医学和科研）中表现不足，需要高事实精确性。现有方法生成的合成数据冗余且未对准模型的知识缺口。

Method: 使用结构熵度量知识图谱路径的不确定性，结合蒙特卡洛树搜索选择性探索模型知识缺乏的区域，生成针对性合成数据进行监督微调。

Result: 在LLaMA-3和Qwen2上的实验表明，SENATOR能有效检测和修复知识缺陷，显著提升性能。

Conclusion: SENATOR框架通过针对性数据生成和微调，显著提升了大语言模型在知识密集型任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented performance by
leveraging vast pretraining corpora, yet their performance remains suboptimal
in knowledge-intensive domains such as medicine and scientific research, where
high factual precision is required. While synthetic data provides a promising
avenue for augmenting domain knowledge, existing methods frequently generate
redundant samples that do not align with the model's true knowledge gaps. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Structural Entropy-guided
Knowledge Navigator (SENATOR) framework that addresses the intrinsic knowledge
deficiencies of LLMs. Our approach employs the Structure Entropy (SE) metric to
quantify uncertainty along knowledge graph paths and leverages Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to selectively explore regions where the model lacks
domain-specific knowledge. Guided by these insights, the framework generates
targeted synthetic data for supervised fine-tuning, enabling continuous
self-improvement. Experimental results on LLaMA-3 and Qwen2 across multiple
domain-specific benchmarks show that SENATOR effectively detects and repairs
knowledge deficiencies, achieving notable performance improvements. The code
and data for our methods and experiments are available at

TLDR: 论文研究了对话式TTS系统的训练方法，发现基于上下文的单句训练优于完整对话训练，效果更好且更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨现有开源架构或训练技术是否足以支持高质量对话式TTS系统的开发。

Method: 比较两种方法：基于上下文的单句训练和完整对话训练，使用20 GPU小时进行实验。

Result: 基于上下文的单句训练MOS得分更高（4.3/5.0 vs 3.7/5.0），训练时间减少37%，且避免了说话人相似性幻觉问题。

Conclusion: 对话式TTS开发应优先采用基于上下文的单句训练，兼顾资源效率和输出质量。

Abstract: Modern TTS systems designed for conversations achieve high-quality utterances
but often remain inaccessible publicly. Are existing open-source architectures
inadequate, or are current training techniques insufficient? This paper
investigates prominent models and their underlying behaviors regarding
conversational context. Using 20 GPU-hours on an NVIDIA H100, we empirically
examine two approaches: context-based utterance-level training versus full
conversation training. Results demonstrate that context-based utterance
training achieves superior MOS scores (4.3/5.0 vs 3.7/5.0) and reduces training
time by 37%, while full conversation approaches suffer from speaker similarity
hallucination issues. These findings provide practical guidelines for
conversational TTS development, favoring utterance-level training with
contextual conditioning for both resource efficiency and output quality.

TLDR: 论文提出了一个12,000项的医疗伦理与安全问答基准，评估中国医疗大语言模型（LLM）的表现，发现其基线性能中等（42.7%准确率），微调后提升至50.8%。研究揭示了LLM在伦理与安全决策中的不足，并提出治理框架以应对风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中国‘健康中国2030’计划下，LLM在医疗领域的应用潜力巨大，但伴随伦理与患者安全挑战，需量化评估并改进治理。

Method: 构建12,000项医疗伦理与安全问答基准，评估中国主流医疗LLM（如Qwen 2.5-32B、DeepSeek）表现，分析微调效果。

Result: LLM基线准确率42.7%，微调后达50.8%，但伦理与安全决策存在显著缺陷，反映监管不足。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁加强LLM治理，提出包含审计团队、数据伦理指南和安全模拟的框架，以平衡AI创新与患者安全。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are poised to transform healthcare under China's
Healthy China 2030 initiative, yet they introduce new ethical and
patient-safety challenges. We present a novel 12,000-item Q&A benchmark
covering 11 ethics and 9 safety dimensions in medical contexts, to
quantitatively evaluate these risks. Using this dataset, we assess
state-of-the-art Chinese medical LLMs (e.g., Qwen 2.5-32B, DeepSeek), revealing
moderate baseline performance (accuracy 42.7% for Qwen 2.5-32B) and significant
improvements after fine-tuning on our data (up to 50.8% accuracy). Results show
notable gaps in LLM decision-making on ethics and safety scenarios, reflecting
insufficient institutional oversight. We then identify systemic governance
shortfalls-including the lack of fine-grained ethical audit protocols, slow
adaptation by hospital IRBs, and insufficient evaluation tools-that currently
hinder safe LLM deployment. Finally, we propose a practical governance
framework for healthcare institutions (embedding LLM auditing teams, enacting
data ethics guidelines, and implementing safety simulation pipelines) to
proactively manage LLM risks. Our study highlights the urgent need for robust
LLM governance in Chinese healthcare, aligning AI innovation with patient
safety and ethical standards.

TLDR: DynamicRAG是一种新型的检索增强生成框架，通过强化学习动态调整检索文档的顺序和数量，显著提升了生成质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统中的重排序器（reranker）通常忽略LLM提供的监督信号，且未解决检索文档数量（k）的最优选择问题。

Method: 提出DynamicRAG框架，将重排序器建模为通过强化学习优化的智能体，利用LLM输出质量作为奖励信号。

Result: 在七个知识密集型数据集上，DynamicRAG表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: DynamicRAG通过动态调整检索策略，显著提升了RAG系统的性能，为知识密集型任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems combine large language models
(LLMs) with external knowledge retrieval, making them highly effective for
knowledge-intensive tasks. A crucial but often under-explored component of
these systems is the reranker, which refines retrieved documents to enhance
generation quality and explainability. The challenge of selecting the optimal
number of documents (k) remains unsolved: too few may omit critical
information, while too many introduce noise and inefficiencies. Although recent
studies have explored LLM-based rerankers, they primarily leverage internal
model knowledge and overlook the rich supervisory signals that LLMs can
provide, such as using response quality as feedback for optimizing reranking
decisions. In this paper, we propose DynamicRAG, a novel RAG framework where
the reranker dynamically adjusts both the order and number of retrieved
documents based on the query. We model the reranker as an agent optimized
through reinforcement learning (RL), using rewards derived from LLM output
quality. Across seven knowledge-intensive datasets, DynamicRAG demonstrates
superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results. The model, data and
code are available at https://github.com/GasolSun36/DynamicRAG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主观答案评分方法存在评分粗糙、缺乏详细推理的问题，且LLM作为评分者易受偏见和不一致性的影响。

Method: 提出SAS-Bench基准，包含细粒度评分、专家标注错误类别和多样化问题类型，并发布开源数据集。

Result: 实验表明，科学类问题评分存在挑战，少量样本提示能显著提高评分准确性。

Conclusion: SAS-Bench为开发更稳健、公平且教育意义强的LLM评分系统提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Subjective Answer Grading (SAG) plays a crucial role in education,
standardized testing, and automated assessment systems, particularly for
evaluating short-form responses in Short Answer Scoring (SAS). However,
existing approaches often produce coarse-grained scores and lack detailed
reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential as
zero-shot evaluators, they remain susceptible to bias, inconsistencies with
human judgment, and limited transparency in scoring decisions. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce SAS-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed
for LLM-based SAS tasks. SAS-Bench provides fine-grained, step-wise scoring,
expert-annotated error categories, and a diverse range of question types
derived from real-world subject-specific exams. This benchmark facilitates
detailed evaluation of model reasoning processes and explainability. We also
release an open-source dataset containing 1,030 questions and 4,109 student
responses, each annotated by domain experts. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive experiments with various LLMs, identifying major challenges in
scoring science-related questions and highlighting the effectiveness of
few-shot prompting in improving scoring accuracy. Our work offers valuable
insights into the development of more robust, fair, and educationally
meaningful LLM-based evaluation systems.

TLDR: VDBA是一种仅需受害者文本的对抗攻击方法，通过影子数据集和分层替代模型设计提高攻击成功率，显著减少查询需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法需要受害者模型知识、大量查询或训练数据，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用公开预训练模型和聚类方法创建影子数据集，设计分层替代模型，结合多种攻击方法生成对抗样本。

Result: 在Emotion和SST5数据集上，VDBA的ASR提升52.08%，查询次数降为0，对LLMs如Qwen2和GPT家族构成威胁。

Conclusion: VDBA证实高级NLP模型仍面临严重安全风险，无需API访问即可实现高攻击成功率。

Abstract: Textual adversarial attacks mislead NLP models, including Large Language
Models (LLMs), by subtly modifying text. While effective, existing attacks
often require knowledge of the victim model, extensive queries, or access to
training data, limiting real-world feasibility. To overcome these constraints,
we introduce the \textbf{Victim Data-based Adversarial Attack (VDBA)}, which
operates using only victim texts. To prevent access to the victim model, we
create a shadow dataset with publicly available pre-trained models and
clustering methods as a foundation for developing substitute models. To address
the low attack success rate (ASR) due to insufficient information feedback, we
propose the hierarchical substitution model design, generating substitute
models to mitigate the failure of a single substitute model at the decision
boundary.
  Concurrently, we use diverse adversarial example generation, employing
various attack methods to generate and select the adversarial example with
better similarity and attack effectiveness. Experiments on the Emotion and SST5
datasets show that VDBA outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an ASR
improvement of 52.08\% while significantly reducing attack queries to 0. More
importantly, we discover that VDBA poses a significant threat to LLMs such as
Qwen2 and the GPT family, and achieves the highest ASR of 45.99% even without
access to the API, confirming that advanced NLP models still face serious
security risks. Our codes can be found at

TLDR: 论文研究了Bradley-Terry（BT）模型在奖励建模中的过优化问题，提出了一种批量零和正则化（BSR）方法以提高模型的分布鲁棒性，并在实验中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BT模型在RLHF中广泛用于奖励建模，但容易出现过优化问题，导致模型在未见数据上泛化性差。本文旨在研究过优化的原因及其对RLHF的影响，并探索提高奖励模型鲁棒性的方法。

Method: 通过分析隐藏状态范数的过度分散是过优化的主要原因，提出BSR方法，强制每批奖励和为零，约束极端奖励值。

Result: BSR在四种过优化场景中均表现出更好的鲁棒性，且在RLHF训练中显著提升了策略与黄金偏好模型的对齐性。在8B规模模型中，BSR在复杂偏好预测任务中提升了5%以上。

Conclusion: BSR能有效提高奖励模型的鲁棒性，进而提升RLHF训练的稳健性。实验表明，鲁棒的奖励模型能显著改善生成任务的效果。

Abstract: The Bradley-Terry (BT) model is widely practiced in reward modeling for
reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). Despite its effectiveness,
reward models (RMs) trained with BT model loss are prone to over-optimization,
losing generalizability to unseen input distributions. In this paper, we study
the cause of over-optimization in RM training and its downstream effects on the
RLHF procedure, accentuating the importance of distributional robustness of RMs
in unseen data. First, we show that the excessive dispersion of hidden state
norms is the main source of over-optimization. Then, we propose batch-wise
sum-to-zero regularization (BSR) to enforce zero-centered reward sum per batch,
constraining the rewards with extreme magnitudes. We assess the impact of BSR
in improving robustness in RMs through four scenarios of over-optimization,
where BSR consistently manifests better robustness. Subsequently, we compare
the plain BT model and BSR on RLHF training and empirically show that robust
RMs better align the policy to the gold preference model. Finally, we apply BSR
to high-quality data and models, which surpasses state-of-the-art RMs in the 8B
scale by adding more than 5% in complex preference prediction tasks. By
conducting RLOO training with 8B RMs, AlpacaEval 2.0 reduces generation length
by 40% while adding a 7% increase in win rate, further highlighting that
robustness in RMs induces robustness in RLHF training. We release the code,
data, and models: https://github.com/LinkedIn-XFACT/RM-Robustness.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）部署的快速增长需要高效的压缩技术以减少计算和内存成本，但剪枝和量化的联合潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 研究联合剪枝和量化的压缩方法，提出新指标SrCr评估语义保留与压缩率的权衡，优化配置。

Result: 实验表明，推荐的组合方法在相同理论压缩率下比单一量化方法性能提升20%。

Conclusion: 联合剪枝和量化的方法在性能与压缩率之间取得更好平衡，SrCr指标为优化配置提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The exponential growth in Large Language Model (LLM) deployment has
intensified the need for efficient model compression techniques to reduce
computational and memory costs. While pruning and quantization have shown
promise, their combined potential remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we
examine joint compression and how strategically combining pruning and
quantization could yield superior performance-to-compression ratios compared to
single-method approaches. Recognizing the challenges in accurately assessing
LLM performance, we address key limitations of previous evaluation frameworks
and introduce the Semantic Retention Compression Rate (SrCr), a novel metric
that quantifies the trade-off between model compression and semantic
preservation, facilitating the optimization of pruning-quantization
configurations. Experiments demonstrate that our recommended combination
achieves, on average, a 20% performance increase compared to an equivalent
quantization-only model at the same theoretical compression rate.

Result: 在多个推理密集型基准测试中性能提升1.4pp至3.5pp，展示了弱到强的扩展性。

Conclusion: AttentionInfluence为推理中心的数据选择提供了可扩展且有效的路径。

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in collecting reasoning-intensive
pretraining data to improve LLMs' complex reasoning ability. Prior approaches
typically rely on supervised classifiers to identify such data, which requires
labeling by humans or LLMs, often introducing domain-specific biases. Due to
the attention heads being crucial to in-context reasoning, we propose
AttentionInfluence, a simple yet effective, training-free method without
supervision signal. Our approach enables a small pretrained language model to
act as a strong data selector through a simple attention head masking
operation. Specifically, we identify retrieval heads and compute the loss
difference when masking these heads. We apply AttentionInfluence to a
1.3B-parameter dense model to conduct data selection on the SmolLM corpus of
241B tokens, and mix the SmolLM corpus with the selected subset comprising 73B
tokens to pretrain a 7B-parameter dense model using 1T training tokens and WSD
learning rate scheduling. Our experimental results demonstrate substantial
improvements, ranging from 1.4pp to 3.5pp, across several knowledge-intensive
and reasoning-heavy benchmarks (i.e., MMLU, MMLU-Pro, AGIEval-en, GSM8K, and
HumanEval). This demonstrates an effective weak-to-strong scaling property,
with small models improving the final performance of larger models-offering a
promising and scalable path for reasoning-centric data selection.

Abstract: Designing effective collaboration structure for multi-agent LLM systems to
enhance collective reasoning is crucial yet remains under-explored. In this
paper, we systematically investigate how collaborative reasoning performance is
affected by three key design dimensions: (1) Expertise-Domain Alignment, (2)
Collaboration Paradigm (structured workflow vs. diversity-driven integration),
and (3) System Scale. Our findings reveal that expertise alignment benefits are
highly domain-contingent, proving most effective for contextual reasoning
tasks. Furthermore, collaboration focused on integrating diverse knowledge
consistently outperforms rigid task decomposition. Finally, we empirically
explore the impact of scaling the multi-agent system with expertise
specialization and study the computational trade off, highlighting the need for
more efficient communication protocol design. This work provides concrete
guidelines for configuring specialized multi-agent system and identifies
critical architectural trade-offs and bottlenecks for scalable multi-agent
reasoning. The code will be made available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 通过模型架构的多样性组合，可以显著提升信息检索系统的相关性和操作效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used for relevance assessment
in information retrieval. However, our study demonstrates that combining two
distinct small language models (SLMs) with different architectures can
outperform LLMs in this task. Our approach -- QUPID -- integrates a generative
SLM with an embedding-based SLM, achieving higher relevance judgment accuracy
while reducing computational costs compared to state-of-the-art LLM solutions.
This computational efficiency makes QUPID highly scalable for real-world search
systems processing millions of queries daily. In experiments across diverse
document types, our method demonstrated consistent performance improvements
(Cohen's Kappa of 0.646 versus 0.387 for leading LLMs) while offering 60x
faster inference times. Furthermore, when integrated into production search
pipelines, QUPID improved nDCG@5 scores by 1.9%. These findings underscore how
architectural diversity in model combinations can significantly enhance both
search relevance and operational efficiency in information retrieval systems.

Conclusion: ViMRHP数据集填补了越南语多模态评论有用性预测的空白，AI辅助标注显著提升了效率，但需进一步优化复杂任务的标注质量。

Abstract: Multimodal Review Helpfulness Prediction (MRHP) is an essential task in
recommender systems, particularly in E-commerce platforms. Determining the
helpfulness of user-generated reviews enhances user experience and improves
consumer decision-making. However, existing datasets focus predominantly on
English and Indonesian, resulting in a lack of linguistic diversity, especially
for low-resource languages such as Vietnamese. In this paper, we introduce
ViMRHP (Vietnamese Multimodal Review Helpfulness Prediction), a large-scale
benchmark dataset for MRHP task in Vietnamese. This dataset covers four
domains, including 2K products with 46K reviews. Meanwhile, a large-scale
dataset requires considerable time and cost. To optimize the annotation
process, we leverage AI to assist annotators in constructing the ViMRHP
dataset. With AI assistance, annotation time is reduced (90 to 120 seconds per
task down to 20 to 40 seconds per task) while maintaining data quality and
lowering overall costs by approximately 65%. However, AI-generated annotations
still have limitations in complex annotation tasks, which we further examine
through a detailed performance analysis. In our experiment on ViMRHP, we
evaluate baseline models on human-verified and AI-generated annotations to
assess their quality differences. The ViMRHP dataset is publicly available at

Abstract: Commonsense knowledge bases (KB) are a source of specialized knowledge that
is widely used to improve machine learning applications. However, even for a
large KB such as ConceptNet, capturing explicit knowledge from each industry
domain is challenging. For example, only a few samples of general {\em tasks}

well-defined knowledge-based volitional action to achieve a particular goal. In
this paper, we aim to fill this gap and present a weakly-supervised framework
to augment commonsense KB with tasks carried out by various industry groups
(IG). We attempt to {\em match} each task with one or more suitable IGs by
training a neural model to learn task-IG affinity and apply clustering to
select the top-k tasks per IG. We extract a total of 2339 triples of the form
$\langle IG, is~capable~of, task \rangle$ from two publicly available news
datasets for 24 IGs with the precision of 0.86. This validates the reliability
of the extracted task-IG pairs that can be directly added to existing KBs.

Abstract: This paper introduces and evaluates three translations of the Grievance
Dictionary, a psycholinguistic dictionary for the analysis of violent,
threatening or grievance-fuelled texts. Considering the relevance of these
themes in languages beyond English, we translated the Grievance Dictionary to
Dutch, German, and Italian. We describe the process of automated translation
supplemented by human annotation. Psychometric analyses are performed,
including internal reliability of dictionary categories and correlations with
the LIWC dictionary. The Dutch and German translations perform similarly to the
original English version, whereas the Italian dictionary shows low reliability
for some categories. Finally, we make suggestions for further validation and
application of the dictionary, as well as for future dictionary translations
following a similar approach.

Conclusion: ToolACE-DEV框架能有效提升工具学习能力，减少对高级模型的依赖。

Abstract: The tool-using capability of large language models (LLMs) enables them to
access up-to-date external information and handle complex tasks. Current
approaches to enhancing this capability primarily rely on distilling advanced
models by data synthesis. However, this method incurs significant costs
associated with advanced model usage and often results in data compatibility
issues, led by the high discrepancy in the knowledge scope between the advanced
model and the target model. To address these challenges, we propose
ToolACE-DEV, a self-improving framework for tool learning. First, we decompose
the tool-learning objective into sub-tasks that enhance basic tool-making and
tool-using abilities. Then, we introduce a self-evolving paradigm that allows
lightweight models to self-improve, reducing reliance on advanced LLMs.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach across models
of varying scales and architectures.

Result: SEReDeEP能更准确地评估幻觉，其语义维度评估与真实情况更一致。

Conclusion: SEReDeEP通过语义熵提升了幻觉检测的准确性，为RAG模型的改进提供了新方向。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models frequently encounter
hallucination phenomena when integrating external information with internal
parametric knowledge. Empirical studies demonstrate that the disequilibrium
between external contextual information and internal parametric knowledge
constitutes a primary factor in hallucination generation. Existing
hallucination detection methodologies predominantly emphasize either the
external or internal mechanism in isolation, thereby overlooking their
synergistic effects. The recently proposed ReDeEP framework decouples these
dual mechanisms, identifying two critical contributors to hallucinations:
excessive reliance on parametric knowledge encoded in feed-forward networks
(FFN) and insufficient utilization of external information by attention
mechanisms (particularly copy heads). ReDeEP quantitatively assesses these
factors to detect hallucinations and dynamically modulates the contributions of
FFNs and copy heads to attenuate their occurrence. Nevertheless, ReDeEP and
numerous other hallucination detection approaches have been employed at
logit-level uncertainty estimation or language-level self-consistency
evaluation, inadequately address the semantic dimensions of model responses,
resulting in inconsistent hallucination assessments in RAG implementations.
Building upon ReDeEP's foundation, this paper introduces SEReDeEP, which
enhances computational processes through semantic entropy captured via trained
linear probes, thereby achieving hallucination assessments that more accurately
reflect ground truth evaluations.

Conclusion: 多维度约束框架有效填补了现有评估方法的不足，为LLMs的指令跟随能力提供了更全面的评估工具。

Abstract: Instruction following evaluates large language models (LLMs) on their ability
to generate outputs that adhere to user-defined constraints. However, existing
benchmarks often rely on templated constraint prompts, which lack the diversity
of real-world usage and limit fine-grained performance assessment. To fill this
gap, we propose a multi-dimensional constraint framework encompassing three
constraint patterns, four constraint categories, and four difficulty levels.
Building on this framework, we develop an automated instruction generation
pipeline that performs constraint expansion, conflict detection, and
instruction rewriting, yielding 1,200 code-verifiable instruction-following
test samples. We evaluate 19 LLMs across seven model families and uncover
substantial variation in performance across constraint forms. For instance,
average performance drops from 77.67% at Level I to 32.96% at Level IV.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of our approach by using it to generate
data for reinforcement learning, achieving substantial gains in instruction
following without degrading general performance. In-depth analysis indicates
that these gains stem primarily from modifications in the model's attention
modules parameters, which enhance constraint recognition and adherence. Code
and data are available in https://github.com/Junjie-Ye/MulDimIF.

Result: IKEA在多项任务中显著优于基线方法，减少检索频率并展现强泛化能力。

Conclusion: IKEA通过协同内部与外部知识，有效解决了检索增强生成中的问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a common strategy to reduce
hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). While reinforcement learning
(RL) can enable LLMs to act as search agents by activating retrieval
capabilities, existing ones often underutilize their internal knowledge. This
can lead to redundant retrievals, potential harmful knowledge conflicts, and
increased inference latency. To address these limitations, an efficient and
adaptive search agent capable of discerning optimal retrieval timing and
synergistically integrating parametric (internal) and retrieved (external)
knowledge is in urgent need. This paper introduces the Reinforced
Internal-External Knowledge Synergistic Reasoning Agent (IKEA), which could
indentify its own knowledge boundary and prioritize the utilization of internal
knowledge, resorting to external search only when internal knowledge is deemed
insufficient. This is achieved using a novel knowledge-boundary aware reward
function and a knowledge-boundary aware training dataset. These are designed
for internal-external knowledge synergy oriented RL, incentivizing the model to
deliver accurate answers, minimize unnecessary retrievals, and encourage
appropriate external searches when its own knowledge is lacking. Evaluations
across multiple knowledge reasoning tasks demonstrate that IKEA significantly
outperforms baseline methods, reduces retrieval frequency significantly, and
exhibits robust generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: 为计算叙事学提供了可扩展的角色分析框架，适用于AI驱动的交互式叙事生成。

Abstract: Detective fiction, a genre defined by its complex narrative structures and
character-driven storytelling, presents unique challenges for computational
narratology, a research field focused on integrating literary theory into
automated narrative generation. While traditional literary studies have offered
deep insights into the methods and archetypes of fictional detectives, these
analyses often focus on a limited number of characters and lack the scalability
needed for the extraction of unique traits that can be used to guide narrative
generation methods. In this paper, we present an AI-driven approach for
systematically characterizing the investigative methods of fictional
detectives. Our multi-phase workflow explores the capabilities of 15 Large
Language Models (LLMs) to extract, synthesize, and validate distinctive
investigative traits of fictional detectives. This approach was tested on a
diverse set of seven iconic detectives - Hercule Poirot, Sherlock Holmes,
William Murdoch, Columbo, Father Brown, Miss Marple, and Auguste Dupin -
capturing the distinctive investigative styles that define each character. The
identified traits were validated against existing literary analyses and further
tested in a reverse identification phase, achieving an overall accuracy of
91.43%, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in capturing the distinctive
investigative approaches of each detective. This work contributes to the
broader field of computational narratology by providing a scalable framework
for character analysis, with potential applications in AI-driven interactive
storytelling and automated narrative generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）的广泛应用，其安全性和对齐问题日益突出。需要一种方法能够识别提示中影响模型输出的部分，以缓解偏见或防御攻击。

Method: ConceptX通过识别提示中的语义丰富概念，并基于输出语义相似性分配重要性，同时支持上下文完整性的保持和灵活的解释目标。

Result: 在三种LLM上，ConceptX在忠实度和人类对齐方面优于TokenSHAP等token级方法。在引导任务中，情感偏移提升至0.252，攻击成功率从0.463降至0.242。

Conclusion: ConceptX为提升LLM安全性和对齐性提供了一种透明且忠实的方法，展示了基于归因的解释性在指导LLM行为中的实用价值。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become widely deployed, concerns about their
safety and alignment grow. An approach to steer LLM behavior, such as
mitigating biases or defending against jailbreaks, is to identify which parts
of a prompt influence specific aspects of the model's output. Token-level
attribution methods offer a promising solution, but still struggle in text
generation, explaining the presence of each token in the output separately,
rather than the underlying semantics of the entire LLM response. We introduce
ConceptX, a model-agnostic, concept-level explainability method that identifies
the concepts, i.e., semantically rich tokens in the prompt, and assigns them
importance based on the outputs' semantic similarity. Unlike current
token-level methods, ConceptX also offers to preserve context integrity through
in-place token replacements and supports flexible explanation goals, e.g.,
gender bias. ConceptX enables both auditing, by uncovering sources of bias, and
steering, by modifying prompts to shift the sentiment or reduce the harmfulness
of LLM responses, without requiring retraining. Across three LLMs, ConceptX
outperforms token-level methods like TokenSHAP in both faithfulness and human
alignment. Steering tasks boost sentiment shift by 0.252 versus 0.131 for
random edits and lower attack success rates from 0.463 to 0.242, outperforming
attribution and paraphrasing baselines. While prompt engineering and
self-explaining methods sometimes yield safer responses, ConceptX offers a
transparent and faithful alternative for improving LLM safety and alignment,
demonstrating the practical value of attribution-based explainability in
guiding LLM behavior.

Motivation: 人类认知与时间感知（Chronoception）紧密相关，但AI在时间有效性推理方面仍有不足。

Method: 使用偏态正态曲线拟合语义分解的时间轴，捕捉知识的新兴、衰减和峰值相关性。包括两个数据集（原子事实和多句段落）。

Result: 基线模型预测曲线参数（位置、尺度和偏度），性能优于基于分类的方法，标注一致性高（84%和89%）。

Conclusion: Chronocept为AI的时间推理提供了基础支持，适用于知识落地、事实核查、检索增强生成和主动代理等应用。

Abstract: Human cognition is deeply intertwined with a sense of time, known as
Chronoception. This sense allows us to judge how long facts remain valid and
when knowledge becomes outdated. Despite progress in vision, language, and
motor control, AI still struggles to reason about temporal validity. We
introduce Chronocept, the first benchmark to model temporal validity as a
continuous probability distribution over time. Using skew-normal curves fitted
along semantically decomposed temporal axes, Chronocept captures nuanced
patterns of emergence, decay, and peak relevance. It includes two datasets:
Benchmark I (atomic facts) and Benchmark II (multi-sentence passages).
Annotations show strong inter-annotator agreement (84% and 89%). Our baselines
predict curve parameters - location, scale, and skewness - enabling
interpretable, generalizable learning and outperforming classification-based
approaches. Chronocept fills a foundational gap in AI's temporal reasoning,
supporting applications in knowledge grounding, fact-checking,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and proactive agents. Code and data are
publicly available.

employment service in Flanders, Belgium. Utilizing Large Language Models
(LLMs), we process unstructured resume data to extract structured career
information, which is then mapped to standardized ESCO occupation codes using a
multi-label classification model. This results in a rich dataset of over 2.3
million work experiences, extracted from and grouped into more than 391,000
user resumes and mapped to standardized ESCO occupation codes, offering
valuable insights into real-world occupational transitions. This dataset
enables diverse applications, such as analyzing labor market mobility, job
stability, and the effects of career breaks on occupational transitions. It
also supports career path prediction and other data-driven decision-making
processes. To illustrate its potential, we explore key dataset characteristics,
including job distributions, career breaks, and job transitions, demonstrating

Conclusion: 语言类型学是渐变的，而非绝对分类。

Abstract: This paper argues that the relationship between lexical identity and prosody
-- one well-studied parameter of linguistic variation -- can be characterized
using information theory. We predict that languages that use prosody to make
lexical distinctions should exhibit a higher mutual information between word
identity and prosody, compared to languages that don't. We test this hypothesis
in the domain of pitch, which is used to make lexical distinctions in tonal
languages, like Cantonese. We use a dataset of speakers reading sentences aloud
in ten languages across five language families to estimate the mutual
information between the text and their pitch curves. We find that, across
languages, pitch curves display similar amounts of entropy. However, these
curves are easier to predict given their associated text in the tonal
languages, compared to pitch- and stress-accent languages, and thus the mutual
information is higher in these languages, supporting our hypothesis. Our
results support perspectives that view linguistic typology as gradient, rather
than categorical.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge, particularly in
scientific domains that demand specialized and dynamic information. Despite its
promise, the application of RAG in the chemistry domain remains underexplored,
primarily due to the lack of high-quality, domain-specific corpora and
well-curated evaluation benchmarks. In this work, we introduce ChemRAG-Bench, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess the effectiveness of
RAG across a diverse set of chemistry-related tasks. The accompanying chemistry
corpus integrates heterogeneous knowledge sources, including scientific
literature, the PubChem database, PubMed abstracts, textbooks, and Wikipedia
entries. In addition, we present ChemRAG-Toolkit, a modular and extensible RAG
toolkit that supports five retrieval algorithms and eight LLMs. Using
ChemRAG-Toolkit, we demonstrate that RAG yields a substantial performance gain
-- achieving an average relative improvement of 17.4% over direct inference
methods. We further conduct in-depth analyses on retriever architectures,
corpus selection, and the number of retrieved passages, culminating in
practical recommendations to guide future research and deployment of RAG
systems in the chemistry domain. The code and data is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于提示的角色扮演方法依赖模型的隐式推理，难以保证逻辑的完整性和一致性。本文旨在通过结构化、可执行的函数来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出Codified Profiles，将角色逻辑表示为可执行的函数，包括条件检查和显式控制结构。通过预处理将推理任务卸载，支持角色行为的持久性和可控随机性。

Result: 在包含83个角色和5,141个场景的基准测试中，Codified Profiles显著提升了角色扮演的持久性、可更新性和行为多样性。即使是1B参数的模型也能实现高质量角色扮演。

Conclusion: Codified Profiles为角色扮演提供了一种可扩展且高效的方法，尤其适合本地部署的角色扮演代理。

Abstract: This paper introduces Codified Profiles for role-playing, a novel approach
that represents character logic as structured, executable functions for
behavioral decision-making. Each profile defines a set of functions
parse_by_scene(scene) that outputs a list of logic-grounded assertions
triggered_statements, using both explicit control structures (e.g.,
if-then-else) and condition checks like check_condition(scene, question), where
each question is a semantically meaningful prompt about the scene (e.g., "Is
the character in danger?") discriminated by the role-playing LLM as true,
false, or unknown. This explicit representation offers three key advantages
over traditional prompt-based profiles, which append character descriptions
directly into text prompts: (1) Persistence, by enforcing complete and
consistent execution of character logic, rather than relying on the model's
implicit reasoning; (2) Updatability, through systematic inspection and
revision of behavioral logic, which is difficult to track or debug in
prompt-only approaches; (3) Controllable Randomness, by supporting stochastic
behavior directly within the logic, enabling fine-grained variability that
prompting alone struggles to achieve. To validate these advantages, we
introduce a new benchmark constructed from 83 characters and 5,141 scenes
curated from Fandom, using NLI-based scoring to compare character responses
against ground-truth actions. Our experiments demonstrate the significant
benefits of codified profiles in improving persistence, updatability, and
behavioral diversity. Notably, by offloading a significant portion of reasoning
to preprocessing, codified profiles enable even 1B-parameter models to perform
high-quality role-playing, providing a scalable and efficient foundation for
local deployment of role-play agents.

Abstract: Spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks involve diverse skills that probe
the information extraction, classification and/or generation capabilities of
models. In this setting, task-specific training data may not always be
available. While traditional task-specific SLU models are unable to cater to
such requirements, the speech-text large language models (LLMs) offer a
promising alternative with emergent abilities. However, out of-the-box, our
evaluations indicate that the zero/few-shot performance of prominent
open-source speech-text LLMs on SLU tasks are not up to the mark. In this
paper, we introduce a novel approach to robust task-agnostic fine-tuning using
randomized class labels. With this proposed fine-tuning, we illustrate that the
performance of the speech-text LLMs on an unseen task is significantly improved
over standard approaches. Critically, the proposed approach avoids the
requirement of task-specific data annotations for enabling new tasks in
speech-text LLMs.

Abstract: Persuasion is a fundamental aspect of communication, influencing
decision-making across diverse contexts, from everyday conversations to
high-stakes scenarios such as politics, marketing, and law. The rise of
conversational AI systems has significantly expanded the scope of persuasion,
introducing both opportunities and risks. AI-driven persuasion can be leveraged
for beneficial applications, but also poses threats through manipulation and
unethical influence. Moreover, AI systems are not only persuaders, but also
susceptible to persuasion, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks and
bias reinforcement. Despite rapid advancements in AI-generated persuasive
content, our understanding of what makes persuasion effective remains limited
due to its inherently subjective and context-dependent nature. In this survey,
we provide a comprehensive overview of computational persuasion, structured
around three key perspectives: (1) AI as a Persuader, which explores
AI-generated persuasive content and its applications; (2) AI as a Persuadee,
which examines AI's susceptibility to influence and manipulation; and (3) AI as
a Persuasion Judge, which analyzes AI's role in evaluating persuasive
strategies, detecting manipulation, and ensuring ethical persuasion. We
introduce a taxonomy for computational persuasion research and discuss key
challenges, including evaluating persuasiveness, mitigating manipulative
persuasion, and developing responsible AI-driven persuasive systems. Our survey
outlines future research directions to enhance the safety, fairness, and
effectiveness of AI-powered persuasion while addressing the risks posed by
increasingly capable language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是了解LLM在生成文本时对训练数据分布的近似能力，尤其是在语义控制环境下。

Method: 通过观察性方法，使用开源LLM重新生成Wikipedia和新闻文本，分析其与原始文本在句法抽象层次上的差异。

Result: 生成的文本分布均值偏移、标准差降低，且长尾现象减少。

Conclusion: LLM在生成文本时未能完全忠实模拟原始数据的分布特性。

Abstract: Recent improvement in large language model performance have, in all
likelihood, been accompanied by improvement in how well they can approximate
the distribution of their training data. In this work, we explore the following
question: which properties of text domains do LLMs faithfully approximate, and
how well do they do so? Applying observational approaches familiar from corpus
linguistics, we prompt a commonly used, opensource LLM to regenerate text from
two domains of permissively licensed English text which are often contained in
LLM training data -- Wikipedia and news text. This regeneration paradigm allows
us to investigate whether LLMs can faithfully match the original human text
domains in a fairly semantically-controlled setting. We investigate varying
levels of syntactic abstraction, from more simple properties like sentence
length, and article readability, to more complex and higher order properties
such as dependency tag distribution, parse depth, and parse complexity. We find
that the majority of the regenerated distributions show a shifted mean, a lower
standard deviation, and a reduction of the long tail, as compared to the human
originals.

TLDR: 论文提出LeaP方法，通过让推理路径间共享中间结果来避免“前缀主导陷阱”，显著提升大模型的自纠正能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现大模型在推理过程中若起始部分较差（前缀主导陷阱），难以自我纠正，受心理学启发提出LeaP方法。

Method: LeaP通过路由机制让推理路径共享中间结果，并微调小模型（LeaP-T）以提升其总结与反思能力。

Result: 实验显示LeaP显著提升性能，如QwQ-32B平均提升5分，LeaP-T-7B在AIME 2024上媲美更大模型。

Conclusion: LeaP通过路径协作实现鲁棒纠错，是大模型推理协作的重要里程碑。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have the ability to self-correct even when they
make mistakes in their reasoning paths. However, our study reveals that when
the reasoning process starts with a short but poor beginning, it becomes
difficult for the model to recover. We refer to this phenomenon as the "Prefix
Dominance Trap". Inspired by psychological findings that peer interaction can
promote self-correction without negatively impacting already accurate
individuals, we propose **Learning from Peers** (LeaP) to address this
phenomenon. Specifically, every tokens, each reasoning path summarizes its
intermediate reasoning and shares it with others through a routing mechanism,
enabling paths to incorporate peer insights during inference. However, we
observe that smaller models sometimes fail to follow summarization and
reflection instructions effectively. To address this, we fine-tune them into
our **LeaP-T** model series. Experiments on AIME 2024, AIME 2025, AIMO 2025,
and GPQA Diamond show that LeaP provides substantial improvements. For
instance, QwQ-32B with LeaP achieves nearly 5 absolute points higher than the
baseline on average, and surpasses DeepSeek-R1-671B on three math benchmarks
with an average gain of 3.3 points. Notably, our fine-tuned LeaP-T-7B matches
the performance of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B on AIME 2024. In-depth analysis
reveals LeaP's robust error correction by timely peer insights, showing strong
error tolerance and handling varied task difficulty. LeaP marks a milestone by
enabling LRMs to collaborate during reasoning. Our code, datasets, and models
are available at https://learning-from-peers.github.io/ .

Result: 提出的缩放定律能够准确预测CPT过程中的损失，并在不同数据集和超参数下保持一致。

Conclusion: CPT缩放定律为优化训练超参数和平衡通用与领域性能提供了理论基础，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Continual Pre-Training (CPT) has become a popular and effective method to
apply strong foundation models to specific downstream tasks. In this work, we
explore the learning dynamics throughout the CPT process for large language
models. We specifically focus on how general and downstream domain performance
evolves at each training step, with domain performance measured via validation
losses. We have observed that the CPT loss curve fundamentally characterizes
the transition from one curve to another hidden curve, and could be described
by decoupling the effects of distribution shift and learning rate annealing. We
derive a CPT scaling law that combines the two factors, enabling the prediction
of loss at any (continual) training steps and across learning rate schedules
(LRS) in CPT. Our formulation presents a comprehensive understanding of several
critical factors in CPT, including loss potential, peak learning rate, training
steps, replay ratio, etc. Moreover, our approach can be adapted to customize
training hyper-parameters to different CPT goals such as balancing general and
domain-specific performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our scaling
law holds across various CPT datasets and training hyper-parameters.

Motivation: 研究匈牙利语静态词嵌入的性能，比较传统模型与基于BERT的嵌入方法，为自然语言处理应用提供参考。

Result: FastText在词类比任务中表现最佳；X2Static提取的BERT嵌入接近传统嵌入效果；ELMo在外在任务中表现最优。

Conclusion: 静态词嵌入在NLP中仍具价值，高级提取方法可提升BERT嵌入的实用性。研究为匈牙利语嵌入性能提供了新见解。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of various static word
embeddings for Hungarian, including traditional models such as Word2Vec,
FastText, as well as static embeddings derived from BERT-based models using
different extraction methods. We evaluate these embeddings on both intrinsic
and extrinsic tasks to provide a holistic view of their performance. For
intrinsic evaluation, we employ a word analogy task, which assesses the
embeddings ability to capture semantic and syntactic relationships. Our results
indicate that traditional static embeddings, particularly FastText, excel in
this task, achieving high accuracy and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) scores. Among
the BERT-based models, the X2Static method for extracting static embeddings
demonstrates superior performance compared to decontextualized and aggregate
methods, approaching the effectiveness of traditional static embeddings. For
extrinsic evaluation, we utilize a bidirectional LSTM model to perform Named
Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging tasks. The results
reveal that embeddings derived from dynamic models, especially those extracted
using the X2Static method, outperform purely static embeddings. Notably, ELMo
embeddings achieve the highest accuracy in both NER and POS tagging tasks,
underscoring the benefits of contextualized representations even when used in a
static form. Our findings highlight the continued relevance of static word
embeddings in NLP applications and the potential of advanced extraction methods
to enhance the utility of BERT-based models. This piece of research contributes
to the understanding of embedding performance in the Hungarian language and
provides valuable insights for future developments in the field. The training
scripts, evaluation codes, restricted vocabulary, and extracted embeddings will
be made publicly available to support further research and reproducibility.

Conclusion: 数字孪生架构在解决医院资源规划问题上具有潜力，能够灵活应对不同场景和资源变化。

Abstract: Digital twins are emerging as a valuable tool for short-term decision-making
as well as for long-term strategic planning across numerous domains, including
process industry, energy, space, transport, and healthcare. This paper reports
on our ongoing work on designing a digital twin to enhance resource planning,
e.g., for the in-patient ward needs in hospitals. By leveraging executable
formal models for system exploration, ontologies for knowledge representation
and an SMT solver for constraint satisfiability, our approach aims to explore
hypothetical "what-if" scenarios to improve strategic planning processes, as
well as to solve concrete, short-term decision-making tasks. Our proposed
solution uses the executable formal model to turn a stream of arriving
patients, that need to be hospitalized, into a stream of optimization problems,
e.g., capturing daily inpatient ward needs, that can be solved by SMT
techniques. The knowledge base, which formalizes domain knowledge, is used to
model the needed configuration in the digital twin, allowing the twin to
support both short-term decision-making and long-term strategic planning by
generating scenarios spanning average-case as well as worst-case resource
needs, depending on the expected treatment of patients, as well as ranging over
variations in available resources, e.g., bed distribution in different rooms.
We illustrate our digital twin architecture by considering the problem of bed
bay allocation in a hospital ward.

in a memory consisting of a knowledge graph enhanced by vector embeddings to
efficiently manage relational information. Third, we combine semantic search
and graph query generation for question answering via Retrieval Augmented
Generation. We illustrate the system's working and potential using a real-world
example.

Motivation: LLM驱动的AI机器人在任务导向对话中表现出潜力，但其知识不可靠且协作效率低，信息传递易受恶意注入。

Method: 采用ASP逻辑编程工具构建双代理系统（AutoManager），通过共享知识库和协作规则集（CRS）实现高效安全的信息传递。

Result: 实验表明，AutoManager在快餐店场景中比真实世界的Taco Bell Drive-Thru AI Order Taker更可靠。

Conclusion: ASP驱动的双代理范式能有效提升任务导向对话的可靠性和安全性，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: As the Large-Language-Model-driven (LLM-driven) Artificial Intelligence (AI)
bots became popular, people realized their strong potential in Task-Oriented
Dialogue (TOD). However, bots relying wholly on LLMs are unreliable in their
knowledge, and whether they can finally produce a correct result for the task
is not guaranteed. The collaboration among these agents also remains a
challenge, since the necessary information to convey is unclear, and the
information transfer is by prompts -- unreliable, and malicious knowledge is
easy to inject. With the help of logic programming tools such as Answer Set
Programming (ASP), conversational agents can be built safely and reliably, and
communication among the agents made more efficient and secure. We proposed an
Administrator-Assistant Dual-Agent paradigm, where the two ASP-driven bots
share the same knowledge base and complete their tasks independently, while the
information can be passed by a Collaborative Rule Set (CRS). The knowledge and
information conveyed are encapsulated and invisible to the users, ensuring the
security of information transmission. We have constructed AutoManager, a
dual-agent system for managing the drive-through window of a fast-food
restaurant such as Taco Bell in the US. In AutoManager, the assistant bot takes
the customer's order while the administrator bot manages the menu and food
supply. We evaluated our AutoManager and compared it with the real-world Taco
Bell Drive-Thru AI Order Taker, and the results show that our method is more
reliable.

Result: 提出了一个开放性分类法，揭示了AI开放性讨论的不足，并与其他学科建立联系。

Conclusion: 呼吁超越开源软件框架，从行动、系统属性和伦理目标等更全面的角度定义AI开放性。

Abstract: The concept of openness in AI has so far been heavily inspired by the
definition and community practice of open source software. This positions
openness in AI as having positive connotations; it introduces assumptions of
certain advantages, such as collaborative innovation and transparency. However,
the practices and benefits of open source software are not fully transferable
to AI, which has its own challenges. Framing a notion of openness tailored to
AI is crucial to addressing its growing societal implications, risks, and
capabilities. We argue that considering the fundamental scope of openness in
different disciplines will broaden discussions, introduce important
perspectives, and reflect on what openness in AI should mean. Toward this goal,
we qualitatively analyze 98 concepts of openness discovered from topic
modeling, through which we develop a taxonomy of openness. Using this taxonomy
as an instrument, we situate the current discussion on AI openness, identify
gaps and highlight links with other disciplines. Our work contributes to the
recent efforts in framing openness in AI by reflecting principles and practices
of openness beyond open source software and calls for a more holistic view of
openness in terms of actions, system properties, and ethical objectives.

Conclusion: KCluster为KC模型设计提供了高效自动化工具，未来可进一步优化教学。

Abstract: Educators evaluate student knowledge using knowledge component (KC) models
that map assessment questions to KCs. Still, designing KC models for large
question banks remains an insurmountable challenge for instructors who need to
analyze each question by hand. The growing use of Generative AI in education is
expected only to aggravate this chronic deficiency of expert-designed KC
models, as course engineers designing KCs struggle to keep up with the pace at
which questions are generated. In this work, we propose KCluster, a novel KC
discovery algorithm based on identifying clusters of congruent questions
according to a new similarity metric induced by a large language model (LLM).
We demonstrate in three datasets that an LLM can create an effective metric of
question similarity, which a clustering algorithm can use to create KC models
from questions with minimal human effort. Combining the strengths of LLM and
clustering, KCluster generates descriptive KC labels and discovers KC models
that predict student performance better than the best expert-designed models
available. In anticipation of future work, we illustrate how KCluster can
reveal insights into difficult KCs and suggest improvements to instruction.

Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of Industry 4.0, achieving efficiency, precision,
and adaptability is essential to optimize manufacturing operations. Industries
suffer due to supply chain disruptions caused by anomalies, which are being
detected by current AI models but leaving domain experts uncertain without
deeper insights into these anomalies. Additionally, operational inefficiencies
persist due to inaccurate production forecasts and the limited effectiveness of
traditional AI models for processing complex sensor data. Despite these
advancements, existing systems lack the seamless integration of these
capabilities needed to create a truly unified solution for enhancing production
and decision-making. We propose SmartPilot, a neurosymbolic, multiagent CoPilot
designed for advanced reasoning and contextual decision-making to address these
challenges. SmartPilot processes multimodal sensor data and is compact to
deploy on edge devices. It focuses on three key tasks: anomaly prediction,
production forecasting, and domain-specific question answering. By bridging the
gap between AI capabilities and real-world industrial needs, SmartPilot
empowers industries with intelligent decision-making and drives transformative
innovation in manufacturing. The demonstration video, datasets, and

Abstract: Traditional logic-based belief revision research focuses on designing rules
to constrain the behavior of revision operators. Frameworks have been proposed
to characterize iterated revision rules, but they are often too loose, leading
to multiple revision operators that all satisfy the rules under the same belief
condition. In many practical applications, such as safety critical ones, it is
important to specify a definite revision operator to enable agents to
iteratively revise their beliefs in a deterministic way. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework for iterated belief revision by characterizing belief
information through preference relations. Semantically, both beliefs and new
evidence are represented as belief algebras, which provide a rich and
expressive foundation for belief revision. Building on traditional revision
rules, we introduce additional postulates for revision with belief algebra,
including an upper-bound constraint on the outcomes of revision. We prove that
the revision result is uniquely determined given the current belief state and
new evidence. Furthermore, to make the framework more useful in practice, we
develop a particular algorithm for performing the proposed revision process. We
argue that this approach may offer a more predictable and principled method for
belief revision, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Method: 通过直接生成CadQuery代码，利用LLMs的Python生成和空间推理能力，并在Text2CAD数据集上微调不同规模的LLMs。

Result: 最佳模型在top-1精确匹配上达到69.3%（提升10.5%），Chamfer Distance减少48.6%。

Conclusion: 直接生成CadQuery代码的方法有效简化了CAD建模流程，且模型规模越大性能越好。

Abstract: Computer-aided design (CAD) is fundamental to modern engineering and
manufacturing, but creating CAD models still requires expert knowledge and
specialized software. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) open up
the possibility of generative CAD, where natural language is directly
translated into parametric 3D models. However, most existing methods generate
task-specific command sequences that pretrained models cannot directly handle.
These sequences must be converted into CAD representations such as CAD vectors
before a 3D model can be produced, which requires training models from scratch
and adds unnecessary complexity. To tackle this issue, we propose generating
CadQuery code directly from text, leveraging the strengths of pretrained LLMs
to produce 3D models without intermediate representations, using this
Python-based scripting language. Since LLMs already excel at Python generation
and spatial reasoning, fine-tuning them on Text-to-CadQuery data proves highly
effective. Given that these capabilities typically improve with scale, we
hypothesize that larger models will perform better after fine-tuning. To enable
this, we augment the Text2CAD dataset with 170,000 CadQuery annotations. We
fine-tune six open-source LLMs of varying sizes and observe consistent
improvements. Our best model achieves a top-1 exact match of 69.3%, up from
58.8%, and reduces Chamfer Distance by 48.6%. Project page:

Abstract: In many real-world planning tasks, agents must tackle uncertainty about the
environment's state and variability in the outcomes of any chosen policy. We
address both forms of uncertainty as a first step toward safer algorithms in
partially observable settings. Specifically, we extend Distributional
Reinforcement Learning (DistRL)-which models the entire return distribution for
fully observable domains-to Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes
(POMDPs), allowing an agent to learn the distribution of returns for each
conditional plan. Concretely, we introduce new distributional Bellman operators
for partial observability and prove their convergence under the supremum
p-Wasserstein metric. We also propose a finite representation of these return
distributions via psi-vectors, generalizing the classical alpha-vectors in
POMDP solvers. Building on this, we develop Distributional Point-Based Value
Iteration (DPBVI), which integrates psi-vectors into a standard point-based
backup procedure-bridging DistRL and POMDP planning. By tracking return
distributions, DPBVI naturally enables risk-sensitive control in domains where
rare, high-impact events must be carefully managed. We provide source code to
foster further research in robust decision-making under partial observability.

Method: DiffATD利用扩散动态维护未观测状态的信念分布，动态平衡探索与利用，结合熵和奖励模型指导采样。

Result: 实验表明，DiffATD在部分可观测环境中表现优于基线方法，与完全可观测的监督方法竞争。

Conclusion: DiffATD提供了一种高效、可解释的目标发现方法，适用于多种高成本数据领域。

Abstract: In various scientific and engineering domains, where data acquisition is
costly, such as in medical imaging, environmental monitoring, or remote
sensing, strategic sampling from unobserved regions, guided by prior
observations, is essential to maximize target discovery within a limited
sampling budget. In this work, we introduce Diffusion-guided Active Target
Discovery (DiffATD), a novel method that leverages diffusion dynamics for
active target discovery. DiffATD maintains a belief distribution over each
unobserved state in the environment, using this distribution to dynamically
balance exploration-exploitation. Exploration reduces uncertainty by sampling
regions with the highest expected entropy, while exploitation targets areas
with the highest likelihood of discovering the target, indicated by the belief
distribution and an incrementally trained reward model designed to learn the
characteristics of the target. DiffATD enables efficient target discovery in a
partially observable environment within a fixed sampling budget, all without
relying on any prior supervised training. Furthermore, DiffATD offers
interpretability, unlike existing black-box policies that require extensive
supervised training. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies across
diverse domains, including medical imaging and remote sensing, we show that
DiffATD performs significantly better than baselines and competitively with
supervised methods that operate under full environmental observability.

Abstract: Robust domain adaptation against adversarial attacks is a critical research
area that aims to develop models capable of maintaining consistent performance
across diverse and challenging domains. In this paper, we derive a new
generalization bound for robust risk on the target domain using a novel
divergence measure specifically designed for robust domain adaptation. Building
upon this, we propose a new algorithm named TAROT, which is designed to enhance
both domain adaptability and robustness. Through extensive experiments, TAROT
not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness but also
significantly enhances domain generalization and scalability by effectively
learning domain-invariant features. In particular, TAROT achieves superior
performance on the challenging DomainNet dataset, demonstrating its ability to
learn domain-invariant representations that generalize well across different
domains, including unseen ones. These results highlight the broader
applicability of our approach in real-world domain adaptation scenarios.

Abstract: Lane-changing (LC) behavior, a critical yet complex driving maneuver,
significantly influences driving safety and traffic dynamics. Traditional
analytical LC decision (LCD) models, while effective in specific environments,
often oversimplify behavioral heterogeneity and complex interactions, limiting
their capacity to capture real LCD. Data-driven approaches address these gaps
by leveraging rich empirical data and machine learning to decode latent
decision-making patterns, enabling adaptive LCD modeling in dynamic
environments. In light of the rapid development of artificial intelligence and
the demand for data-driven models oriented towards connected vehicles and
autonomous vehicles, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of data-driven
LCD models, with a particular focus on human drivers LC decision-making. It
systematically reviews the modeling framework, covering data sources and
preprocessing, model inputs and outputs, objectives, structures, and validation
methods. This survey further discusses the opportunities and challenges faced
by data-driven LCD models, including driving safety, uncertainty, as well as
the integration and improvement of technical frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模多智能体强化学习（MARL）因智能体交互的指数增长导致计算复杂度高和学习效率低，现有均值场（MF）方法无法捕捉个体差异，导致聚合噪声。

Method: 提出双层次均值场（BMF）方法，包括动态分组模块（使用VAE学习智能体表示）和双层次交互模块（建模组内和组间交互）。

Result: 实验表明，BMF在多种任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BMF通过动态分组和双层次交互有效缓解了聚合噪声，提升了大规模MARL的性能。

Abstract: Large-scale Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) often suffers from the
curse of dimensionality, as the exponential growth in agent interactions
significantly increases computational complexity and impedes learning
efficiency. To mitigate this, existing efforts that rely on Mean Field (MF)
simplify the interaction landscape by approximating neighboring agents as a
single mean agent, thus reducing overall complexity to pairwise interactions.
However, these MF methods inevitably fail to account for individual
differences, leading to aggregation noise caused by inaccurate iterative
updates during MF learning. In this paper, we propose a Bi-level Mean Field
(BMF) method to capture agent diversity with dynamic grouping in large-scale
MARL, which can alleviate aggregation noise via bi-level interaction.
Specifically, BMF introduces a dynamic group assignment module, which employs a
Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) to learn the representations of agents,
facilitating their dynamic grouping over time. Furthermore, we propose a
bi-level interaction module to model both inter- and intra-group interactions
for effective neighboring aggregation. Experiments across various tasks
demonstrate that the proposed BMF yields results superior to the
state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be made publicly available.

Result: 实验结果表明，新方法在多个基准测试中显著优于现有VI方法。

Conclusion: 新方法通过预处理和猜测值技术，显著提升了VI算法的效率，为MCs和MDPs的优化问题提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Two standard models for probabilistic systems are Markov chains (MCs) and
Markov decision processes (MDPs). Classic objectives for such probabilistic
models for control and planning problems are reachability and stochastic
shortest path. The widely studied algorithmic approach for these problems is
the Value Iteration (VI) algorithm which iteratively applies local updates
called Bellman updates. There are many practical approaches for VI in the
literature but they all require exponentially many Bellman updates for MCs in
the worst case. A preprocessing step is an algorithm that is discrete,
graph-theoretical, and requires linear space. An important open question is
whether, after a polynomial-time preprocessing, VI can be achieved with
sub-exponentially many Bellman updates. In this work, we present a new approach
for VI based on guessing values. Our theoretical contributions are twofold.
First, for MCs, we present an almost-linear-time preprocessing algorithm after
which, along with guessing values, VI requires only subexponentially many
Bellman updates. Second, we present an improved analysis of the speed of
convergence of VI for MDPs. Finally, we present a practical algorithm for MDPs
based on our new approach. Experimental results show that our approach provides
a considerable improvement over existing VI-based approaches on several
benchmark examples from the literature.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems represent a new frontier in artificial intelligence, where
agents often based on large language models(LLMs) interact with tools,
environments, and other agents to accomplish tasks with a degree of autonomy.
These systems show promise across a range of domains, but their architectural
underpinnings remain immature. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of
the types of agents, their modes of interaction with the environment, and the
infrastructural and architectural challenges that emerge. We identify a gap in
how these systems manage tool orchestration at scale and propose a reusable
design abstraction: the "Control Plane as a Tool" pattern. This pattern allows
developers to expose a single tool interface to an agent while encapsulating
modular tool routing logic behind it. We position this pattern within the
broader context of agent design and argue that it addresses several key
challenges in scaling, safety, and extensibility.

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction has long been a major challenge for autonomous
driving (AD). Traditional data-driven models predominantly rely on statistical
correlations, often overlooking the causal relationships that govern traffic
behavior. In this paper, we introduce a novel trajectory prediction framework
that leverages causal inference to enhance predictive robustness,
generalization, and accuracy. By decomposing the environment into spatial and
temporal components, our approach identifies and mitigates spurious
correlations, uncovering genuine causal relationships. We also employ a
progressive fusion strategy to integrate multimodal information, simulating
human-like reasoning processes and enabling real-time inference. Evaluations on
five real-world datasets--ApolloScape, nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and
MoCAD--demonstrate our model's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods, with improvements in key metrics such as RMSE and FDE. Our
findings highlight the potential of causal reasoning to transform trajectory
prediction, paving the way for robust AD systems.

Abstract: The ultimate goal of artificial intelligence (AI) is to achieve Artificial
General Intelligence (AGI). Embodied Artificial Intelligence (EAI), which
involves intelligent systems with physical presence and real-time interaction
with the environment, has emerged as a key research direction in pursuit of
AGI. While advancements in deep learning, reinforcement learning, large-scale
language models, and multimodal technologies have significantly contributed to
the progress of EAI, most existing reviews focus on specific technologies or
applications. A systematic overview, particularly one that explores the direct
connection between EAI and AGI, remains scarce. This paper examines EAI as a
foundational approach to AGI, systematically analyzing its four core modules:
perception, intelligent decision-making, action, and feedback. We provide a
detailed discussion of how each module contributes to the six core principles
of AGI. Additionally, we discuss future trends, challenges, and research
directions in EAI, emphasizing its potential as a cornerstone for AGI
development. Our findings suggest that EAI's integration of dynamic learning
and real-world interaction is essential for bridging the gap between narrow AI
and AGI.

Conclusion: 本文为API的发展奠定基础，强调PFI作为关键技术，未来研究方向包括提升个性化、计算效率和隐私保障。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and
Grok-3, has reshaped the artificial intelligence landscape. As prominent
examples of foundational models (FMs) built on LLMs, these models exhibit
remarkable capabilities in generating human-like content, bringing us closer to
achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). However, their large-scale
nature, sensitivity to privacy concerns, and substantial computational demands
present significant challenges to personalized customization for end users. To
bridge this gap, this paper presents the vision of artificial personalized
intelligence (API), focusing on adapting these powerful models to meet the
specific needs and preferences of users while maintaining privacy and
efficiency. Specifically, this paper proposes personalized federated
intelligence (PFI), which integrates the privacy-preserving advantages of
federated learning (FL) with the zero-shot generalization capabilities of FMs,
enabling personalized, efficient, and privacy-protective deployment at the
edge. We first review recent advances in both FL and FMs, and discuss the
potential of leveraging FMs to enhance federated systems. We then present the
key motivations behind realizing PFI and explore promising opportunities in
this space, including efficient PFI, trustworthy PFI, and PFI empowered by
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Finally, we outline key challenges and
future research directions for deploying FM-powered FL systems at the edge with
improved personalization, computational efficiency, and privacy guarantees.
Overall, this survey aims to lay the groundwork for the development of API as a
complement to AGI, with a particular focus on PFI as a key enabling technique.

Conclusion: CKG为可扩展的因果推断提供了一个通用框架，结合了知识图谱的推理能力和因果模型的推断能力。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs and structural causal models have each proven valuable for
organizing biomedical knowledge and estimating causal effects, but remain
largely disconnected: knowledge graphs encode qualitative relationships
focusing on facts and deductive reasoning without formal probabilistic
semantics, while causal models lack integration with background knowledge in
knowledge graphs and have no access to the deductive reasoning capabilities
that knowledge graphs provide. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel
formulation of Causal Knowledge Graphs (CKGs) which extend knowledge graphs
with formal causal semantics, preserving their deductive capabilities while
enabling principled causal inference. CKGs support deconfounding via explicitly
marked causal edges and facilitate hypothesis formulation aligned with both
encoded and entailed background knowledge. We constructed a Drug-Disease CKG
(DD-CKG) integrating disease progression pathways, drug indications,
side-effects, and hierarchical disease classification to enable automated
large-scale mediation analysis. Applied to UK Biobank and MIMIC-IV cohorts, we
tested whether drugs mediate effects between indications and downstream disease
progression, adjusting for confounders inferred from the DD-CKG. Our approach
successfully reproduced known adverse drug reactions with high precision while
identifying previously undocumented significant candidate adverse effects.
Further validation through side effect similarity analysis demonstrated that
combining our predicted drug effects with established databases significantly
improves the prediction of shared drug indications, supporting the clinical
relevance of our novel findings. These results demonstrate that our methodology
provides a generalizable, knowledge-driven framework for scalable causal
inference.

Result: 较小的通用LLMs对ILs有知识，但缺乏领域推理能力。

Conclusion: LLMs在碳捕获研究中需进一步优化，以同时支持科学研究和碳减排目标。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in
diverse general knowledge and reasoning tasks, their utility in the scientific
domain of Chemical and Biological Engineering (CBE) is unclear. Hence, it
necessitates challenging evaluation benchmarks that can measure LLM performance
in knowledge- and reasoning-based tasks, which is lacking. As a foundational
step, we empirically measure the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in CBE. We
construct and share an expert-curated dataset of 5,920 examples for
benchmarking LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the niche domain of Ionic Liquids
(ILs) for carbon sequestration, an emergent solution to reducing global
warming. The dataset presents different difficulty levels by varying along the
dimensions of linguistic and domain-specific knowledge. Benchmarking three less
than 10B parameter open-source LLMs on the dataset suggests that while smaller
general-purpose LLMs are knowledgeable about ILs, they lack domain-specific
reasoning capabilities. Based on our results, we further discuss considerations
for leveraging LLMs for carbon capture research using ILs. Since LLMs have a
high carbon footprint, gearing them for IL research can symbiotically benefit
both fields and help reach the ambitious carbon neutrality target by 2050.

Result: 在视觉、语言和视觉语言任务上的实验表明，CAT Merging显著抑制了知识冲突，平均准确率提升了2.5%（ViT-B/32）和2.0%（ViT-L/14）。

Conclusion: CAT Merging是一种高效且无需训练的多任务模型合并方法，能够显著提升性能并减少知识冲突。

Abstract: Multi-task model merging offers a promising paradigm for integrating multiple
expert models into a unified model without additional training. Existing
state-of-the-art techniques, such as Task Arithmetic and its variants, merge
models by accumulating task vectors -- the parameter differences between
pretrained and finetuned models. However, task vector accumulation is often
hindered by knowledge conflicts, leading to performance degradation. To address
this challenge, we propose Conflict-Aware Task Merging (CAT Merging), a novel
training-free framework that selectively trims conflict-prone components from
the task vectors. CAT Merging introduces several parameter-specific strategies,
including projection for linear weights and masking for scaling and shifting
parameters in normalization layers. Extensive experiments on vision, language,
and vision-language tasks demonstrate that CAT Merging effectively suppresses
knowledge conflicts, achieving average accuracy improvements of up to 2.5%
(ViT-B/32) and 2.0% (ViT-L/14) over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Mobile crowdsensing is evolving beyond traditional human-centric models by
integrating heterogeneous entities like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and
unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). Optimizing task allocation among these diverse
agents is critical, particularly in challenging emergency rescue scenarios
characterized by complex environments, limited communication, and partial
observability. This paper tackles the Heterogeneous-Entity
Collaborative-Sensing Task Allocation (HECTA) problem specifically for
emergency rescue, considering humans, UAVs, and UGVs. We introduce a novel
``Hard-Cooperative'' policy where UGVs prioritize recharging low-battery UAVs,
alongside performing their sensing tasks. The primary objective is maximizing
the task completion rate (TCR) under strict time constraints. We rigorously
formulate this NP-hard problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov
decision process (Dec-POMDP) to effectively handle sequential decision-making
under uncertainty. To solve this, we propose HECTA4ER, a novel multi-agent
reinforcement learning algorithm built upon a Centralized Training with
Decentralized Execution architecture. HECTA4ER incorporates tailored designs,
including specialized modules for complex feature extraction, utilization of
action-observation history via hidden states, and a mixing network integrating
global and local information, specifically addressing the challenges of partial
observability. Furthermore, theoretical analysis confirms the algorithm's
convergence properties. Extensive simulations demonstrate that HECTA4ER
significantly outperforms baseline algorithms, achieving an average 18.42%
increase in TCR. Crucially, a real-world case study validates the algorithm's
effectiveness and robustness in dynamic sensing scenarios, highlighting its
strong potential for practical application in emergency response.

Abstract: In recent years, Artificial Intelligence technology has excelled in various
applications across all domains and fields. However, the various algorithms in
neural networks make it difficult to understand the reasons behind decisions.
For this reason, trustworthy AI techniques have started gaining popularity. The
concept of trustworthiness is cross-disciplinary; it must meet societal
standards and principles, and technology is used to fulfill these requirements.
In this paper, we first surveyed developments from various countries and
regions on the ethical elements that make AI algorithms trustworthy; and then
focused our survey on the state of the art research into the interpretability
of AI. We have conducted an intensive survey on technologies and techniques
used in making AI explainable. Finally, we identified new trends in achieving
explainable AI. In particular, we elaborate on the strong link between the
explainability of AI and the meta-reasoning of autonomous systems. The concept
of meta-reasoning is 'reason the reasoning', which coincides with the intention
and goal of explainable Al. The integration of the approaches could pave the

Abstract: Retrosynthesis, the process of breaking down a target molecule into simpler
precursors through a series of valid reactions, stands at the core of organic
chemistry and drug development. Although recent machine learning (ML) research
has advanced single-step retrosynthetic modeling and subsequent route searches,
these solutions remain restricted by the extensive combinatorial space of
possible pathways. Concurrently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited
remarkable chemical knowledge, hinting at their potential to tackle complex
decision-making tasks in chemistry. In this work, we explore whether LLMs can
successfully navigate the highly constrained, multi-step retrosynthesis
planning problem. We introduce an efficient scheme for encoding reaction
pathways and present a new route-level search strategy, moving beyond the
conventional step-by-step reactant prediction. Through comprehensive
evaluations, we show that our LLM-augmented approach excels at retrosynthesis
planning and extends naturally to the broader challenge of synthesizable
molecular design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统故障检测方法在处理高维数据和非线性关系时效率低下，且梯度优化方法收敛慢。

Result: 在真实WSNs数据集上达到99.72%分类准确率，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且适用于大规模WSNs，是资源受限网络的重大进步。

Abstract: Fault detection in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is crucial for reliable
data transmission and network longevity. Traditional fault detection methods
often struggle with optimizing deep neural networks (DNNs) for efficient
performance, especially in handling high-dimensional data and capturing
nonlinear relationships. Additionally, these methods typically suffer from slow
convergence and difficulty in finding optimal network architectures using
gradient-based optimization. This study proposes a novel hybrid method
combining Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with a DNN optimized by the
Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) to address these limitations. Our
approach begins by computing eigenvalues from the original 12-dimensional
dataset and sorting them in descending order. The cumulative sum of these
values is calculated, retaining principal components until 99.5% variance is
achieved, effectively reducing dimensionality to 4 features while preserving
critical information. This compressed representation trains a six-layer DNN
where GOA optimizes the network architecture, overcoming backpropagation's
limitations in discovering nonlinear relationships. This hybrid PCA-GOA-DNN
framework compresses the data and trains a six-layer DNN that is optimized by
GOA, enhancing both training efficiency and fault detection accuracy. The
dataset used in this study is a real-world WSNs dataset developed by the
University of North Carolina, which was used to evaluate the proposed method's
performance. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our approach achieves a
remarkable 99.72% classification accuracy, with exceptional precision and
recall, outperforming conventional methods. The method is computationally
efficient, making it suitable for large-scale WSN deployments, and represents a
significant advancement in fault detection for resource-constrained WSNs.

Abstract: We propose DialogueReason, a reasoning paradigm that uncovers the lost roles
in monologue-style reasoning models, aiming to boost diversity and coherency of
the reasoning process. Recent advances in RL-based large reasoning models have
led to impressive long CoT capabilities and high performance on math and
science benchmarks. However, these reasoning models rely mainly on
monologue-style reasoning, which often limits reasoning diversity and
coherency, frequently recycling fixed strategies or exhibiting unnecessary
shifts in attention. Our work consists of an analysis of monologue reasoning
patterns and the development of a dialogue-based reasoning approach. We first
introduce the Compound-QA task, which concatenates multiple problems into a
single prompt to assess both diversity and coherency of reasoning. Our analysis
shows that Compound-QA exposes weaknesses in monologue reasoning, evidenced by
both quantitative metrics and qualitative reasoning traces. Building on the
analysis, we propose a dialogue-based reasoning, named DialogueReason,
structured around agents, environment, and interactions. Using PPO with
rule-based rewards, we train open-source LLMs (Qwen-QWQ and Qwen-Base) to adopt
dialogue reasoning. We evaluate trained models on MATH, AIME, and GPQA
datasets, showing that the dialogue reasoning model outperforms monologue
models under more complex compound questions. Additionally, we discuss how
dialogue-based reasoning helps enhance interpretability, facilitate more
intuitive human interaction, and inspire advances in multi-agent system design.

Conclusion: 通过选择图的引入，本文成功弥补了现有方法在非块结构决策建模上的不足，为过程发现提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Process discovery aims to automatically derive process models from event
logs, enabling organizations to analyze and improve their operational
processes. Inductive mining algorithms, while prioritizing soundness and
efficiency through hierarchical modeling languages, often impose a strict
block-structured representation. This limits their ability to accurately
capture the complexities of real-world processes. While recent advancements
like the Partially Ordered Workflow Language (POWL) have addressed the
block-structure limitation for concurrency, a significant gap remains in
effectively modeling non-block-structured decision points. In this paper, we
bridge this gap by proposing an extension of POWL to handle
non-block-structured decisions through the introduction of choice graphs.
Choice graphs offer a structured yet flexible approach to model complex
decision logic within the hierarchical framework of POWL. We present an
inductive mining discovery algorithm that uses our extension and preserves the
quality guarantees of the inductive mining framework. Our experimental
evaluation demonstrates that the discovered models, enriched with choice
graphs, more precisely represent the complex decision-making behavior found in
real-world processes, without compromising the high scalability inherent in
inductive mining techniques.

Conclusion: 研究强调了将心理学启发的关系学习机制整合到通用人工智能框架中的潜力，展示了NARS在关系学习方面的能力。

Abstract: Same/opposite relational responding, a fundamental aspect of human symbolic
cognition, allows the flexible generalization of stimulus relationships based
on minimal experience. In this study, we demonstrate the emergence of
\textit{arbitrarily applicable} same/opposite relational responding within the
Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS), a computational cognitive architecture
designed for adaptive reasoning under uncertainty. Specifically, we extend NARS
with an implementation of \textit{acquired relations}, enabling the system to
explicitly derive both symmetric (mutual entailment) and novel relational
combinations (combinatorial entailment) from minimal explicit training in a
contextually controlled matching-to-sample (MTS) procedure. Experimental
results show that NARS rapidly internalizes explicitly trained relational rules
and robustly demonstrates derived relational generalizations based on arbitrary
contextual cues. Importantly, derived relational responding in critical test
phases inherently combines both mutual and combinatorial entailments, such as
deriving same-relations from multiple explicitly trained opposite-relations.
Internal confidence metrics illustrate strong internalization of these
relational principles, closely paralleling phenomena observed in human
relational learning experiments. Our findings underscore the potential for
integrating nuanced relational learning mechanisms inspired by learning
psychology into artificial general intelligence frameworks, explicitly
highlighting the arbitrary and context-sensitive relational capabilities
modeled within NARS.

Abstract: One goal of AI (and AGI) is to identify and understand specific mechanisms
and representations sufficient for general intelligence. Often, this work
manifests in research focused on architectures and many cognitive architectures
have been explored in AI/AGI. However, different research groups and even
different research traditions have somewhat independently identified
similar/common patterns of processes and representations or cognitive design
patterns that are manifest in existing architectures. Today, AI systems
exploiting large language models (LLMs) offer a relatively new combination of
mechanism and representation available for exploring the possibilities of
general intelligence. In this paper, we summarize a few recurring cognitive
design patterns that have appeared in various pre-transformer AI architectures.
We then explore how these patterns are evident in systems using LLMs,
especially for reasoning and interactive ("agentic") use cases. By examining
and applying these recurring patterns, we can also predict gaps or deficiencies
in today's Agentic LLM Systems and identify likely subjects of future research
towards general intelligence using LLMs and other generative foundation models.

Motivation: 现有LLM驱动的自动化渗透测试（AutoPT）框架在复杂任务中表现不佳，主要由于知识不平衡、短视规划和命令生成幻觉等问题，且缺乏从失败操作中学习的机制。

Method: 提出RefPentester框架，结合知识驱动和自反思机制，通过七状态阶段机模型指导渗透测试的各个阶段，包括阶段识别、策略选择、行动建议和失败学习。

Result: RefPentester在Hack The Box的Sau机器上成功泄露凭证，性能优于基线GPT-4o模型16.7%，并在各渗透测试阶段表现出更高的成功率。

Abstract: Automated penetration testing (AutoPT) powered by large language models
(LLMs) has gained attention for its ability to automate ethical hacking
processes and identify vulnerabilities in target systems by leveraging the
intrinsic knowledge of LLMs. However, existing LLM-based AutoPT frameworks
often underperform compared to human experts in challenging tasks for several
reasons: the imbalanced knowledge used in LLM training, short-sighted planning
in the planning process, and hallucinations during command generation. In
addition, the penetration testing (PT) process, with its trial-and-error
nature, is limited by existing frameworks that lack mechanisms to learn from
previous failed operations, restricting adaptive improvement of PT strategies.
To address these limitations, we propose a knowledge-informed self-reflective
PT framework powered by LLMs, called RefPentester, which is an AutoPT framework
designed to assist human operators in identifying the current stage of the PT
process, selecting appropriate tactic and technique for the stage, choosing
suggested action, providing step-by-step operational guidance, and learning
from previous failed operations. We also modeled the PT process as a
seven-state Stage Machine to integrate the proposed framework effectively. The
evaluation shows that RefPentester can successfully reveal credentials on Hack
The Box's Sau machine, outperforming the baseline GPT-4o model by 16.7\%.
Across PT stages, RefPentester also demonstrates superior success rates on PT
stage transitions.

Motivation: 现实知识图谱中关系呈现长尾分布，现有方法仅关注正三元组或简单利用负三元组，限制了性能提升。

Method: 通过随机替换尾实体生成负三元组，并在扩散过程中条件结合正负信息，同时引入注意力池化机制。

Result: 在两个广泛使用的数据集上，ReCDAP优于现有方法，达到最优性能。

Conclusion: ReCDAP通过有效利用正负三元组信息，显著提升了知识图谱补全效果。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs), composed of triples in the form of (head, relation,
tail) and consisting of entities and relations, play a key role in information
retrieval systems such as question answering, entity search, and
recommendation. In real-world KGs, although many entities exist, the relations
exhibit a long-tail distribution, which can hinder information retrieval
performance. Previous few-shot knowledge graph completion studies focused
exclusively on the positive triple information that exists in the graph or,
when negative triples were incorporated, used them merely as a signal to
indicate incorrect triples. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Relation-Based Conditional Diffusion with Attention Pooling (ReCDAP). First,
negative triples are generated by randomly replacing the tail entity in the
support set. By conditionally incorporating positive information in the KG and
non-existent negative information into the diffusion process, the model
separately estimates the latent distributions for positive and negative
relations. Moreover, including an attention pooler enables the model to
leverage the differences between positive and negative cases explicitly.
Experiments on two widely used datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The code is
available at https://github.com/hou27/ReCDAP-FKGC.

Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies
raises concerns about the accountability of sociotechnical systems. Current
generative AI systems rely on complex mechanisms that make it difficult for
even experts to fully trace the reasons behind the outputs. This paper first
examines existing research on AI transparency and accountability and argues
that transparency is not a sufficient condition for accountability but can
contribute to its improvement. We then discuss that if it is not possible to
make generative AI transparent, generative AI technology becomes ``artificially
created nature'' in a metaphorical sense, and suggest using the precautionary
principle approach to consider AI risks. Finally, we propose that a platform
for citizen participation is needed to address the risks of generative AI.

Abstract: We present gg-bench, a collection of game environments designed to evaluate
general reasoning capabilities in language models. Unlike most static
benchmarks, gg-bench is a data generating process where new evaluation
instances can be generated at will. In particular, gg-bench is synthetically
generated by (1) using a large language model (LLM) to generate natural
language descriptions of novel games, (2) using the LLM to implement each game
in code as a Gym environment, and (3) training reinforcement learning (RL)
agents via self-play on the generated games. We evaluate language models by
their winrate against these RL agents by prompting models with the game
description, current board state, and a list of valid moves, after which models
output the moves they wish to take. gg-bench is challenging: state-of-the-art
LLMs such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.7 Sonnet achieve winrates of 7-9% on gg-bench
using in-context learning, while reasoning models such as o1, o3-mini and
DeepSeek-R1 achieve average winrates of 31-36%. We release the generated games,
data generation process, and evaluation code in order to support future
modeling work and expansion of our benchmark.

Abstract: The increasing penetration of information and communication technologies in
the design, monitoring, and control of water systems enables the use of
algorithms for detecting and identifying unanticipated events (such as leakages
or water contamination) using sensor measurements. However, data-driven
methodologies do not always give accurate results and are often not trusted by
operators, who may prefer to use their engineering judgment and experience to
deal with such events.
  In this work, we propose a framework for interpretable event diagnosis -- an
approach that assists the operators in associating the results of algorithmic
event diagnosis methodologies with their own intuition and experience. This is
achieved by providing contrasting (i.e., counterfactual) explanations of the
results provided by fault diagnosis algorithms; their aim is to improve the
understanding of the algorithm's inner workings by the operators, thus enabling
them to take a more informed decision by combining the results with their
personal experiences. Specifically, we propose counterfactual event
fingerprints, a representation of the difference between the current event
diagnosis and the closest alternative explanation, which can be presented in a
graphical way. The proposed methodology is applied and evaluated on a realistic
use case using the L-Town benchmark.

Result: 实验证明FedIFL在标签空间不一致的联邦跨域诊断中表现优异。

Conclusion: FedIFL能有效提升全局模型的泛化能力，适用于标签空间不一致的故障诊断场景。

Abstract: Due to the scarcity of industrial data, individual equipment users,
particularly start-ups, struggle to independently train a comprehensive fault
diagnosis model; federated learning enables collaborative training while
ensuring data privacy, making it an ideal solution. However, the diversity of
working conditions leads to variations in fault modes, resulting in
inconsistent label spaces across different clients. In federated diagnostic
scenarios, label space inconsistency leads to local models focus on
client-specific fault modes and causes local models from different clients to
map different failure modes to similar feature representations, which weakens
the aggregated global model's generalization. To tackle this issue, this
article proposed a federated cross-domain diagnostic framework termed Federated
Invariant Features Learning (FedIFL). In intra-client training, prototype
contrastive learning mitigates intra-client domain shifts, subsequently,
feature generating ensures local models can access distributions of other
clients in a privacy-friendly manner. Besides, in cross-client training, a
feature disentanglement mechanism is introduced to mitigate cross-client domain
shifts, specifically, an instance-level federated instance consistency loss is
designed to ensure the instance-level consistency of invariant features between
different clients, furthermore, a federated instance personalization loss and
an orthogonal loss are constructed to distinguish specific features that from
the invariant features. Eventually, the aggregated model achieves promising
generalization among global label spaces, enabling accurate fault diagnosis for
target clients' Motor Driven Systems (MDSs) with inconsistent label spaces.
Experiments on real-world MDSs validate the effectiveness and superiority of
FedIFL in federated cross-domain diagnosis with inconsistent fault modes.

Abstract: With the increasing demands for safety, efficiency, and sustainability in
global shipping, Automatic Identification System (AIS) data plays an
increasingly important role in maritime monitoring. AIS data contains
spatial-temporal variation patterns of vessels that hold significant research
value in the marine domain. However, due to its massive scale, the full
potential of AIS data has long remained untapped. With its powerful sequence
modeling capabilities, particularly its ability to capture long-range
dependencies and complex temporal dynamics, the Transformer model has emerged
as an effective tool for processing AIS data. Therefore, this paper reviews the
research on Transformer-based AIS data-driven maritime monitoring, providing a
comprehensive overview of the current applications of Transformer models in the
marine field. The focus is on Transformer-based trajectory prediction methods,
behavior detection, and prediction techniques. Additionally, this paper
collects and organizes publicly available AIS datasets from the reviewed
papers, performing data filtering, cleaning, and statistical analysis. The
statistical results reveal the operational characteristics of different vessel
types, providing data support for further research on maritime monitoring
tasks. Finally, we offer valuable suggestions for future research, identifying
two promising research directions. Datasets are available at

Conclusion: 需提升LLMs对现实表格输入的鲁棒性，改进评估方法以更准确反映其性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks, but less is
known about their reasoning capabilities over tabular data. Prior analyses
devise evaluation strategies that poorly reflect an LLM's realistic performance
on tabular queries. Moreover, we have a limited understanding of the robustness
of LLMs towards realistic variations in tabular inputs. Therefore, we ask: Can
general-purpose LLMs reason over tabular data, really?, and focus on two
questions 1) are tabular reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs robust
to real-world characteristics of tabular inputs, and 2) how can we
realistically evaluate an LLM's performance on analytical tabular queries?
Building on a recent tabular reasoning benchmark, we first surface shortcomings
of its multiple-choice prompt evaluation strategy, as well as commonly used
free-form text metrics such as SacreBleu and BERT-score. We show that an
LLM-as-a-judge procedure yields more reliable performance insights and unveil a
significant deficit in tabular reasoning performance of LLMs. We then extend
the tabular inputs reflecting three common characteristics in practice: 1)
missing values, 2) duplicate entities, and 3) structural variations.
Experiments show that the tabular reasoning capabilities of general-purpose
LLMs suffer from these variations, stressing the importance of improving their
robustness for realistic tabular inputs.

interaction mechanisms (pipeline, routing, auxiliary, distillation, fusion),
key enabling technologies, and diverse application scenarios driven by
on-device needs like low latency, privacy, personalization, and offline
operation. While highlighting the significant potential for creating more
efficient, adaptable, and accessible AI, we also discuss persistent challenges
including system overhead, inter-model consistency, robust task allocation,
evaluation complexity, and security/privacy concerns. Future directions point
towards more intelligent adaptive frameworks, deeper model fusion, and
expansion into multimodal and embodied AI, positioning LLM-SLM collaboration as
a key driver for the next generation of practical and ubiquitous artificial
intelligence.

### [289] [Web-Bench: A LLM Code Benchmark Based on Web Standards and Frameworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07473)
*Kai Xu,YiWei Mao,XinYi Guan,ZiLong Feng*

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 论文提出新基准Web-Bench，解决现有代码生成基准饱和问题，模拟真实开发流程，挑战性强，SOTA模型表现显著低于其他基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成基准（如HumanEval、MBPP）已饱和，无法有效指导LLM优化，需新基准模拟真实开发场景。

Method: 设计Web-Bench，包含50个项目，每个项目20个任务，模拟人类开发流程，覆盖Web标准和框架。

Result: SOTA模型Claude 3.7 Sonnet在Web-Bench上Pass@1仅25.1%，显著低于其他基准表现。

Conclusion: 标准和框架是开发领域的基础，LLM需针对其优化，Web-Bench为未来研究提供新方向。

Abstract: The application of large language models (LLMs) in the field of coding is
evolving rapidly: from code assistants, to autonomous coding agents, and then
to generating complete projects through natural language. Early LLM code
benchmarks primarily focused on code generation accuracy, but these benchmarks
have gradually become saturated. Benchmark saturation weakens their guiding
role for LLMs. For example, HumanEval Pass@1 has reached 99.4% and MBPP 94.2%.
Among various attempts to address benchmark saturation, approaches based on
software engineering have stood out, but the saturation of existing software
engineering benchmarks is rapidly increasing. To address this, we propose a new
benchmark, Web-Bench, which contains 50 projects, each consisting of 20 tasks
with sequential dependencies. The tasks implement project features in sequence,
simulating real-world human development workflows. When designing Web-Bench, we
aim to cover the foundational elements of Web development: Web Standards and
Web Frameworks. Given the scale and complexity of these projects, which were
designed by engineers with 5 to 10 years of experience, each presents a
significant challenge. On average, a single project takes 4 to 8 hours for a
senior engineer to complete. On our given benchmark agent (Web-Agent), SOTA
(Claude 3.7 Sonnet) achieves only 25.1% Pass@1, significantly lower (better)
than SWE-Bench's Verified (65.4%) and Full (33.8%) scores. Finally, we discuss
that in any development field, Standards and Frameworks represent foundational
knowledge and efficiency tools, respectively, and LLMs require optimization
tailored to them.

*Feng Ding,Tingting Wang,Yupeng Gao,Shuo Yu,Jing Ren,Feng Xia*

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: HALO框架通过半衰期理论量化历史事实的时间有效性，过滤时态知识图中的过时事实，提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理方法忽视过时事实的负面影响，且训练这些事实增加计算成本。

Method: HALO包含三个模块：时态事实注意力模块、动态关系感知编码模块和过时事实过滤模块。

Result: HALO在三个公开数据集上优于现有方法，有效检测和过滤过时事实。

Conclusion: HALO通过量化时间有效性，显著提升时态知识图推理性能。

Abstract: Outdated facts in temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) result from exceeding the
expiration date of facts, which negatively impact reasoning performance on
TKGs. However, existing reasoning methods primarily focus on positive
importance of historical facts, neglecting adverse effects of outdated facts.
Besides, training on these outdated facts yields extra computational cost. To
address these challenges, we propose an outdated fact filtering framework named
HALO, which quantifies the temporal validity of historical facts by exploring
the half-life theory to filter outdated facts in TKGs. HALO consists of three
modules: the temporal fact attention module, the dynamic relation-aware encoder
module, and the outdated fact filtering module. Firstly, the temporal fact
attention module captures the evolution of historical facts over time to
identify relevant facts. Secondly, the dynamic relation-aware encoder module is
designed for efficiently predicting the half life of each fact. Finally, we
construct a time decay function based on the half-life theory to quantify the
temporal validity of facts and filter outdated facts. Experimental results show
that HALO outperforms the state-of-the-art TKG reasoning methods on three
public datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting and filtering
outdated facts (Codes are available at
https://github.com/yushuowiki/K-Half/tree/main ).

Abstract: Leveraging large language model (LLM) based agents to simulate human social
behaviors has recently gained significant attention. In this paper, we
introduce a novel social simulator called YuLan-OneSim. Compared to previous
works, YuLan-OneSim distinguishes itself in five key aspects: (1) Code-free
scenario construction: Users can simply describe and refine their simulation
scenarios through natural language interactions with our simulator. All
simulation code is automatically generated, significantly reducing the need for
programming expertise. (2) Comprehensive default scenarios: We implement 50
default simulation scenarios spanning 8 domains, including economics,
sociology, politics, psychology, organization, demographics, law, and
communication, broadening access for a diverse range of social researchers. (3)
Evolvable simulation: Our simulator is capable of receiving external feedback
and automatically fine-tuning the backbone LLMs, significantly enhancing the
simulation quality. (4) Large-scale simulation: By developing a fully
responsive agent framework and a distributed simulation architecture, our
simulator can handle up to 100,000 agents, ensuring more stable and reliable
simulation results. (5) AI social researcher: Leveraging the above features, we
develop an AI social researcher. Users only need to propose a research topic,
and the AI researcher will automatically analyze the input, construct
simulation environments, summarize results, generate technical reports, review
and refine the reports--completing the social science research loop. To
demonstrate the advantages of YuLan-OneSim, we conduct experiments to evaluate
the quality of the automatically generated scenarios, the reliability,
efficiency, and scalability of the simulation process, as well as the
performance of the AI social researcher.

*Muzhi Dai,Chenxu Yang,Qingyi Si*

Main category: cs.AI

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为S-GRPO的新型强化学习方法，通过序列组衰减奖励策略优化，使模型能够判断推理步骤的充分性并提前终止链式思考（CoT）生成，从而减少冗余思考并提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理模型（如Qwen3）在链式思考生成中存在过度冗余的问题，传统基于结果奖励的强化学习方法未能有效调控中间推理步骤。

Method: 提出S-GRPO方法，通过在单个CoT生成中选择多个时间点允许模型提前终止思考并生成答案，并对正确答案按位置分配衰减奖励，鼓励模型在早期阶段生成高质量答案。

Result: 实验表明，S-GRPO与Qwen3和Deepseek-distill等先进推理模型兼容，在多个基准测试中实现了35.4%~61.1%的序列长度减少和0.72%~6.08%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: S-GRPO通过优化奖励策略，显著减少了推理模型的冗余思考，提升了效率和准确性。

Abstract: As Test-Time Scaling emerges as an active research focus in the large
language model community, advanced post-training methods increasingly emphasize
extending chain-of-thought (CoT) generation length, thereby enhancing reasoning
capabilities to approach Deepseek R1-like reasoning models. However, recent
studies reveal that reasoning models (even Qwen3) consistently exhibit
excessive thought redundancy in CoT generation. This overthinking problem stems
from conventional outcome-reward reinforcement learning's systematic neglect in
regulating intermediate reasoning steps. This paper proposes Serial-Group
Decaying-Reward Policy Optimization (namely S-GRPO), a novel reinforcement
learning method that empowers models with the capability to determine the
sufficiency of reasoning steps, subsequently triggering early exit of CoT
generation. Specifically, unlike GRPO, which samples multiple possible
completions (parallel group) in parallel, we select multiple temporal positions
in the generation of one CoT to allow the model to exit thinking and instead
generate answers (serial group), respectively. For the correct answers in a
serial group, we assign rewards that decay according to positions, with lower
rewards towards the later ones, thereby reinforcing the model's behavior to
generate higher-quality answers at earlier phases with earlier exits of
thinking. Empirical evaluations demonstrate compatibility with state-of-the-art
reasoning models, including Qwen3 and Deepseek-distill models, achieving 35.4%
~ 61.1\% sequence length reduction with 0.72% ~ 6.08% accuracy improvements
across GSM8K, AIME 2024, AMC 2023, MATH-500, and GPQA Diamond benchmarks.

Result: 讨论了实际应用、实现考虑、伦理影响，并展望了未来认知治理的研究方向。

Conclusion: 信念注入是一种有前景的认知治理工具，未来研究可进一步探索其架构嵌入和应用潜力。

Abstract: This work introduces belief injection, a proactive epistemic control
mechanism for artificial agents whose cognitive states are structured as
dynamic ensembles of linguistic belief fragments. Grounded in the Semantic
Manifold framework, belief injection directly incorporates targeted linguistic
beliefs into an agent's internal cognitive state, influencing reasoning and
alignment proactively rather than reactively. We delineate various injection
strategies, such as direct, context-aware, goal-oriented, and reflective
approaches, and contrast belief injection with related epistemic control
mechanisms, notably belief filtering. Additionally, this work discusses
practical applications, implementation considerations, ethical implications,
and outlines promising directions for future research into cognitive governance
using architecturally embedded belief injection.

<details>

Motivation: 旨在解决AGI开发中的安全性和开放性挑战，通过情感驱动和元认知提升学习效率和适应性。

Method: 引入可微分的内在奖励函数，结合元认知映射和受限的自我修改操作，定义初始配置和动态条件。

Result: 提出了量化语义学习的指标（意义密度和意义转换效率），并建立了单代理理论基础。

Conclusion: EG-MRSI为开放且安全的AGI提供了可扩展的理论基础，未来将扩展至安全性、集体智能和可行性约束。

Abstract: We present the Emotion-Gradient Metacognitive Recursive Self-Improvement
(EG-MRSI) framework, a novel architecture that integrates introspective
metacognition, emotion-based intrinsic motivation, and recursive
self-modification into a unified theoretical system. The framework is
explicitly capable of overwriting its own learning algorithm under formally
bounded risk. Building upon the Noise-to-Meaning RSI (N2M-RSI) foundation,
EG-MRSI introduces a differentiable intrinsic reward function driven by
confidence, error, novelty, and cumulative success. This signal regulates both
a metacognitive mapping and a self-modification operator constrained by
provable safety mechanisms. We formally define the initial agent configuration,
emotion-gradient dynamics, and RSI trigger conditions, and derive a
reinforcement-compatible optimization objective that guides the agent's
development trajectory. Meaning Density and Meaning Conversion Efficiency are
introduced as quantifiable metrics of semantic learning, closing the gap
between internal structure and predictive informativeness. This Part I paper
establishes the single-agent theoretical foundations of EG-MRSI. Future parts
will extend this framework to include safety certificates and rollback
protocols (Part II), collective intelligence mechanisms (Part III), and
feasibility constraints including thermodynamic and computational limits (Part
IV). Together, the EG-MRSI series provides a rigorous, extensible foundation
for open-ended and safe AGI.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Virtual Assistants
(VAs) e.g., Google Gemini, ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and High-Flyer Deepseek
has turned them into convenient interfaces for managing emerging technologies
such as Smart Homes, Smart Cars, Electronic Health Records, by means of
explicit commands,e.g., prompts, which can be even launched via voice, thus
providing a very convenient interface for end-users. However, the proper
specification and evaluation of User-Managed Access Control Policies (U-MAPs),
the rules issued and managed by end-users to govern access to sensitive data
and device functionality - within these VAs presents significant challenges,
since such a process is crucial for preventing security vulnerabilities and
privacy leaks without impacting user experience. This study provides an initial
exploratory investigation on whether current publicly-available VAs can manage
U-MAPs effectively across differing scenarios. By conducting unstructured to
structured tests, we evaluated the comprehension of such VAs, revealing a lack
of understanding in varying U-MAP approaches. Our research not only identifies
key limitations, but offers valuable insights into how VAs can be further
improved to manage complex authorization rules and adapt to dynamic changes.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在需要精确计算的数学推理任务中表现不佳，研究如何通过强化学习（RL）让模型自主利用外部工具（如代码执行）具有重要意义。

Method: 提出ZeroTIR方法，通过基于结果的强化学习训练LLMs，使其自发生成并执行Python代码解决数学问题，使用解耦的代码执行环境验证方法。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了自主工具使用的学习与扩展机制，为未来研究提供了可复现的基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical reasoning tasks
requiring precise, verifiable computation. While Reinforcement Learning (RL)
from outcome-based rewards enhances text-based reasoning, understanding how
agents autonomously learn to leverage external tools like code execution
remains crucial. We investigate RL from outcome-based rewards for
Tool-Integrated Reasoning, ZeroTIR, training base LLMs to spontaneously
generate and execute Python code for mathematical problems without supervised
tool-use examples. Our central contribution is we demonstrate that as RL
training progresses, key metrics scale predictably. Specifically, we observe
strong positive correlations where increased training steps lead to increases
in the spontaneous code execution frequency, the average response length, and,
critically, the final task accuracy. This suggests a quantifiable relationship
between computational effort invested in training and the emergence of
effective, tool-augmented reasoning strategies. We implement a robust framework
featuring a decoupled code execution environment and validate our findings
across standard RL algorithms and frameworks. Experiments show ZeroTIR
significantly surpasses non-tool ZeroRL baselines on challenging math
benchmarks. Our findings provide a foundational understanding of how autonomous
tool use is acquired and scales within Agent RL, offering a reproducible
benchmark for future studies. Code is released at

Abstract: Pretraining datasets are foundational to the development of multimodal

web-scale corpora they are sourced from. In this paper, we investigate the
prevalence of toxicity in LLaVA image-text pretraining dataset, examining how
harmful content manifests in different modalities. We present a comprehensive
analysis of common toxicity categories and propose targeted mitigation
strategies, resulting in the creation of a refined toxicity-mitigated dataset.
This dataset removes 7,531 of toxic image-text pairs in the LLaVA pre-training
dataset. We offer guidelines for implementing robust toxicity detection
pipelines. Our findings underscore the need to actively identify and filter
toxic content - such as hate speech, explicit imagery, and targeted harassment
- to build more responsible and equitable multimodal systems. The
toxicity-mitigated dataset is open source and is available for further

Method: 提出了一种结合ACO的模型选择方法和上下文感知的温度调节框架，根据图像质量、疾病复杂性和模型置信度动态调整温度。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上表现优异，准确率分别为98.01%（Kaggle）、92.81%（Figshare）和96.20%（GastroNet），均超过现有基准。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了医学图像识别的性能，为复杂医学数据的处理提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical disease prediction, particularly through imaging, remains a
challenging task due to the complexity and variability of medical data,
including noise, ambiguity, and differing image quality. Recent deep learning
models, including Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods, have shown promising
results in brain tumor image identification but still face limitations in
handling uncertainty and generalizing across diverse medical conditions.
Traditional KD methods often rely on a context-unaware temperature parameter to
soften teacher model predictions, which does not adapt effectively to varying
uncertainty levels present in medical images. To address this issue, we propose
a novel framework that integrates Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for optimal
teacher-student model selection and a novel context-aware predictor approach
for temperature scaling. The proposed context-aware framework adjusts the
temperature based on factors such as image quality, disease complexity, and
teacher model confidence, allowing for more robust knowledge transfer.
Additionally, ACO efficiently selects the most appropriate teacher-student
model pair from a set of pre-trained models, outperforming current optimization
methods by exploring a broader solution space and better handling complex,
non-linear relationships within the data. The proposed framework is evaluated
using three publicly available benchmark datasets, each corresponding to a
distinct medical imaging task. The results demonstrate that the proposed
framework significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving
top accuracy rates: 98.01% on the MRI brain tumor (Kaggle) dataset, 92.81% on
the Figshare MRI dataset, and 96.20% on the GastroNet dataset. This enhanced
performance is further evidenced by the improved results, surpassing existing
benchmarks of 97.24% (Kaggle), 91.43% (Figshare), and 95.00% (GastroNet).

Abstract: Recent advancements in super-resolution for License Plate Recognition (LPR)
have sought to address challenges posed by low-resolution (LR) and degraded
images in surveillance, traffic monitoring, and forensic applications. However,
existing studies have relied on private datasets and simplistic degradation
models. To address this gap, we introduce UFPR-SR-Plates, a novel dataset
containing 10,000 tracks with 100,000 paired low and high-resolution license
plate images captured under real-world conditions. We establish a benchmark
using multiple sequential LR and high-resolution (HR) images per vehicle --
five of each -- and two state-of-the-art models for super-resolution of license
plates. We also investigate three fusion strategies to evaluate how combining
predictions from a leading Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model for
multiple super-resolved license plates enhances overall performance. Our
findings demonstrate that super-resolution significantly boosts LPR
performance, with further improvements observed when applying majority
vote-based fusion techniques. Specifically, the Layout-Aware and
Character-Driven Network (LCDNet) model combined with the Majority Vote by
Character Position (MVCP) strategy led to the highest recognition rates,
increasing from 1.7% with low-resolution images to 31.1% with super-resolution,
and up to 44.7% when combining OCR outputs from five super-resolved images.
These findings underscore the critical role of super-resolution and temporal
information in enhancing LPR accuracy under real-world, adverse conditions. The
proposed dataset is publicly available to support further research and can be
accessed at: https://valfride.github.io/nascimento2024toward/

Result: 在大规模数据集上的实验表明，MAGE在准确性和连续性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAGE通过多阶段渐进预测策略，有效提升了全身姿态推断的准确性和运动序列的连贯性。

Abstract: Inferring full-body poses from Head Mounted Devices, which capture only
3-joint observations from the head and wrists, is a challenging task with wide
AR/VR applications. Previous attempts focus on learning one-stage motion
mapping and thus suffer from an over-large inference space for unobserved body
joint motions. This often leads to unsatisfactory lower-body predictions and
poor temporal consistency, resulting in unrealistic or incoherent motion
sequences. To address this, we propose a powerful Multi-stage Avatar GEnerator
named MAGE that factorizes this one-stage direct motion mapping learning with a
progressive prediction strategy. Specifically, given initial 3-joint motions,
MAGE gradually inferring multi-scale body part poses at different abstract
granularity levels, starting from a 6-part body representation and gradually
refining to 22 joints. With decreasing abstract levels step by step, MAGE
introduces more motion context priors from former prediction stages and thus
improves realistic motion completion with richer constraint conditions and less
ambiguity. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets verify that MAGE
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with better accuracy and
continuity.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been integrated into autonomous driving
systems to enhance reasoning capabilities through tasks such as Visual Question
Answering (VQA). However, the robustness of these systems against backdoor
attacks remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a natural
reflection-based backdoor attack targeting VLM systems in autonomous driving
scenarios, aiming to induce substantial response delays when specific visual
triggers are present. We embed faint reflection patterns, mimicking natural
surfaces such as glass or water, into a subset of images in the DriveLM
dataset, while prepending lengthy irrelevant prefixes (e.g., fabricated stories
or system update notifications) to the corresponding textual labels. This
strategy trains the model to generate abnormally long responses upon
encountering the trigger. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art VLMs, Qwen2-VL and
LLaMA-Adapter, using parameter-efficient methods. Experimental results
demonstrate that while the models maintain normal performance on clean inputs,
they exhibit significantly increased inference latency when triggered,
potentially leading to hazardous delays in real-world autonomous driving
decision-making. Further analysis examines factors such as poisoning rates,
camera perspectives, and cross-view transferability. Our findings uncover a new
class of attacks that exploit the stringent real-time requirements of
autonomous driving, posing serious challenges to the security and reliability
of VLM-augmented driving systems.

*Jingrui He,Andrew Stephen McGough*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种通过改进损失函数的方法，解决StyleGAN/2生成人脸图像时的特征纠缠问题，从而保持面部表情不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: StyleGAN/2在生成人脸图像时存在特征纠缠问题，即修改某一特征（如性别或年龄）会影响其他特征（如表情）。这限制了其在面部表情研究中的应用。

Method: 在现有模型的基础上，引入预训练的人脸关键点检测模型（HFLD）的损失函数，作为原始损失函数的补充，以减少表情变化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能减少表情变化的49%，并在定量和定性评估中优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了特征纠缠问题，为面部表情研究提供了可靠的数据增强手段。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Network approaches such as StyleGAN/2 provide two key
benefits: the ability to generate photo-realistic face images and possessing a
semantically structured latent space from which these images are created. Many
approaches have emerged for editing images derived from vectors in the latent
space of a pre-trained StyleGAN/2 models by identifying semantically meaningful
directions (e.g., gender or age) in the latent space. By moving the vector in a
specific direction, the ideal result would only change the target feature while
preserving all the other features. Providing an ideal data augmentation
approach for gesture research as it could be used to generate numerous image
variations whilst keeping the facial expressions intact. However, entanglement
issues, where changing one feature inevitably affects other features, impacts
the ability to preserve facial expressions. To address this, we propose the use
of an addition to the loss function of a Facial Keypoint Detection model to
restrict changes to the facial expressions. Building on top of an existing
model, adding the proposed Human Face Landmark Detection (HFLD) loss, provided
by a pre-trained Facial Keypoint Detection model, to the original loss
function. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the existing and our
extended model, showing the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the
entanglement issue and maintaining the facial expression. Our approach achieves
up to 49% reduction in the change of emotion in our experiments. Moreover, we
show the benefit of our approach by comparing with state-of-the-art models. By
increasing the ability to preserve the facial gesture and expression during
facial transformation, we present a way to create human face images with fixed
expression but different appearances, making it a reliable data augmentation
approach for Facial Gesture and Expression research.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: PromptIQ是一个自动化框架，通过改进提示和使用新指标CAS评估图像质量，解决了T2I模型在生成高质量图像时的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前T2I模型对提示的误解导致图像质量不佳，而现有评估方法（如CLIP）无法捕捉结构性问题。

Method: PromptIQ通过迭代生成和评估图像，结合CAS指标检测结构错误，优化提示。

Result: PromptIQ显著提高了生成质量和评估准确性。

Conclusion: PromptIQ使T2I模型对非专业用户更易用。

Abstract: Generating high-quality images without prompt engineering expertise remains a
challenge for text-to-image (T2I) models, which often misinterpret poorly
structured prompts, leading to distortions and misalignments. While humans
easily recognize these flaws, metrics like CLIP fail to capture structural
inconsistencies, exposing a key limitation in current evaluation methods. To
address this, we introduce PromptIQ, an automated framework that refines
prompts and assesses image quality using our novel Component-Aware Similarity
(CAS) metric, which detects and penalizes structural errors. Unlike
conventional methods, PromptIQ iteratively generates and evaluates images until
the user is satisfied, eliminating trial-and-error prompt tuning. Our results
show that PromptIQ significantly improves generation quality and evaluation
accuracy, making T2I models more accessible for users with little to no prompt
engineering expertise.

TLDR: HCMA框架通过全局和局部对齐模块，在文本到图像生成中实现语义保真和空间控制，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂场景中难以同时满足高级语义保真和明确的空间控制需求。

Method: HCMA结合全局对齐模块（确保场景一致性）和局部对齐模块（通过边界框实现细粒度空间控制）。

Result: 在MS-COCO 2014验证集上，HCMA在FID和CLIP Score上分别提升0.69和0.0295。

Conclusion: HCMA为语义基础的图像生成提供了高效解决方案，兼顾语义和空间控制。

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis has progressed to the point where models can generate
visually compelling images from natural language prompts. Yet, existing methods
often fail to reconcile high-level semantic fidelity with explicit spatial
control, particularly in scenes involving multiple objects, nuanced relations,
or complex layouts. To bridge this gap, we propose a Hierarchical Cross-Modal
Alignment (HCMA) framework for grounded text-to-image generation. HCMA
integrates two alignment modules into each diffusion sampling step: a global
module that continuously aligns latent representations with textual
descriptions to ensure scene-level coherence, and a local module that employs
bounding-box layouts to anchor objects at specified locations, enabling
fine-grained spatial control. Extensive experiments on the MS-COCO 2014
validation set show that HCMA surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a
0.69 improvement in Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and a 0.0295 gain in CLIP
Score. These results demonstrate HCMA's effectiveness in faithfully capturing
intricate textual semantics while adhering to user-defined spatial constraints,
offering a robust solution for semantically grounded image generation.Our code

Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) semantic segmentation provides comprehensive
environmental perception for autonomous driving but suffers multi-modal
misalignment and sensor noise. We propose RESAR-BEV, a progressive refinement
framework that advances beyond single-step end-to-end approaches: (1)
progressive refinement through residual autoregressive learning that decomposes
BEV segmentation into interpretable coarse-to-fine stages via our
Drive-Transformer and Modifier-Transformer residual prediction cascaded
architecture, (2) robust BEV representation combining ground-proximity voxels
with adaptive height offsets and dual-path voxel feature encoding
(max+attention pooling) for efficient feature extraction, and (3) decoupled
supervision with offline Ground Truth decomposition and online joint
optimization to prevent overfitting while ensuring structural coherence.
Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate RESAR-BEV achieves state-of-the-art
performance with 54.0% mIoU across 7 essential driving-scene categories while
maintaining real-time capability at 14.6 FPS. The framework exhibits robustness
in challenging scenarios of long-range perception and adverse weather

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种量子冲突指示器（QCI）用于测量量子Dempster-Shafer理论（QDST）中多个量子质量函数（QMF）之间的冲突，并验证其性能。QCI应用于冲突融合方法，并进一步优化了C-DDS方法用于OOD检测任务，实验结果显示性能优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QDST中多个QMF之间的冲突管理是一个挑战性问题，需要一种有效的冲突测量方法。

Method: 提出QCI测量QMF间的冲突，并验证其性质；将QCI应用于冲突融合方法；优化C-DDS方法用于OOD检测。

Result: QCI满足冲突测量的理想性质；QCI融合方法优于其他方法；优化后的C-DDS+在OOD检测中表现优异，AUC提升1.2%，FPR95降低5.4%。

Conclusion: QCI是有效的冲突测量工具，其融合方法和优化的C-DDS+在OOD检测中显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Quantum Dempster-Shafer Theory (QDST) uses quantum interference effects to
derive a quantum mass function (QMF) as a fuzzy metric type from information
obtained from various data sources. In addition, QDST uses quantum parallel
computing to speed up computation. Nevertheless, the effective management of
conflicts between multiple QMFs in QDST is a challenging question. This work
aims to address this problem by proposing a Quantum Conflict Indicator (QCI)
that measures the conflict between two QMFs in decision-making. Then, the
properties of the QCI are carefully investigated. The obtained results validate
its compliance with desirable conflict measurement properties such as
non-negativity, symmetry, boundedness, extreme consistency and insensitivity to
refinement. We then apply the proposed QCI in conflict fusion methods and
compare its performance with several commonly used fusion approaches. This
comparison demonstrates the superiority of the QCI-based conflict fusion
method. Moreover, the Class Description Domain Space (C-DDS) and its optimized
version, C-DDS+ by utilizing the QCI-based fusion method, are proposed to
address the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection task. The experimental results
show that the proposed approach gives better OOD performance with respect to
several state-of-the-art baseline OOD detection methods. Specifically, it
achieves an average increase in Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 1.2% and a corresponding average decrease in
False Positive Rate at 95% True Negative Rate (FPR95) of 5.4% compared to the
optimal baseline method.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种基于长跟踪特征的视觉-惯性里程计（VIO）方法，通过主动解耦累积误差和优化实时性能，提高了定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长跟踪特征能约束更多视觉帧以减少定位漂移，但会引入累积匹配误差和跟踪漂移。现有方法基于重投影误差调整观测权重存在缺陷，可能误导优化过程。

Method: 提出主动解耦机制，包括视觉参考帧重置策略消除累积误差，深度预测策略利用长期约束，并采用三种状态估计策略优化实时性能。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种数据集上实现了更高的定位精度和较短的耗时，适用于边缘低空物联网导航。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了长跟踪特征的累积误差和实时性能问题，提升了VIO系统的实用性。

Abstract: This paper presents a visual-inertial odometry (VIO) method using
long-tracked features. Long-tracked features can constrain more visual frames,
reducing localization drift. However, they may also lead to accumulated
matching errors and drift in feature tracking. Current VIO methods adjust
observation weights based on re-projection errors, yet this approach has flaws.
Re-projection errors depend on estimated camera poses and map points, so
increased errors might come from estimation inaccuracies, not actual feature
tracking errors. This can mislead the optimization process and make
long-tracked features ineffective for suppressing localization drift.
Furthermore, long-tracked features constrain a larger number of frames, which
poses a significant challenge to real-time performance of the system. To tackle
these issues, we propose an active decoupling mechanism for accumulated errors
in long-tracked feature utilization. We introduce a visual reference frame
reset strategy to eliminate accumulated tracking errors and a depth prediction
strategy to leverage the long-term constraint. To ensure real time preformane,
we implement three strategies for efficient system state estimation: a parallel
elimination strategy based on predefined elimination order, an inverse-depth
elimination simplification strategy, and an elimination skipping strategy.
Experiments on various datasets show that our method offers higher positioning
accuracy with relatively short consumption time, making it more suitable for
edge-enabled low-altitude IoT navigation, where high-accuracy positioning and
real-time operation on edge device are required. The code will be published at
github.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种因果提示校准方法（CPC-SAM），用于解决Segment Anything Model（SAM）在开放词汇多实体分割（OVMS）中的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM在OVMS任务中存在泛化问题，主要原因是提示偏差与任务无关的生成因素相关，这些因素作为混淆变量影响模型性能。

Method: 通过因果分析，提出因果提示作为校准目标，并基于因果多分布一致性理论设计CPC-SAM方法，结合轻量级因果提示学习器（CaPL）优化提示。

Result: 实验验证了CPC-SAM在OVMS任务中的优越性。

Conclusion: CPC-SAM通过消除提示中的混淆变量，显著提升了SAM在OVMS任务中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Despite the strength of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), it struggles with
generalization issues in open-vocabulary multi-entity segmentation (OVMS).
Through empirical and causal analyses, we find that (i) the prompt bias is the
primary cause of the generalization issues; (ii) this bias is closely tied to
the task-irrelevant generating factors within the prompts, which act as
confounders and affect generalization. To address the generalization issues, we
aim to propose a method that can calibrate prompts to eliminate confounders for
accurate OVMS. Building upon the causal analysis, we propose that the optimal
prompt for OVMS should contain only task-relevant causal factors. We define it
as the causal prompt, serving as the goal of calibration. Next, our theoretical
analysis, grounded by causal multi-distribution consistency theory, proves that
this prompt can be obtained by enforcing segmentation consistency and
optimality. Inspired by this, we propose CPC-SAM, a Causal Prompt Calibration
method for SAM to achieve accurate OVMS. It integrates a lightweight causal
prompt learner (CaPL) into SAM to obtain causal prompts. Specifically, we first
generate multiple prompts using random annotations to simulate diverse
distributions and then reweight them via CaPL by enforcing causal
multi-distribution consistency in both task and entity levels. To ensure
obtaining causal prompts, CaPL is optimized by minimizing the cumulative
segmentation loss across the reweighted prompts to achieve consistency and
optimality. A bi-level optimization strategy alternates between optimizing CaPL
and SAM, ensuring accurate OVMS. Extensive experiments validate its
superiority.

Abstract: Deformable registration is a fundamental task in medical image processing,
aiming to achieve precise alignment by establishing nonlinear correspondences
between images. Traditional methods offer good adaptability and
interpretability but are limited by computational efficiency. Although deep
learning approaches have significantly improved registration speed and
accuracy, they often lack flexibility and generalizability across different
datasets and tasks. In recent years, foundation models have emerged as a
promising direction, leveraging large and diverse datasets to learn universal
features and transformation patterns for image registration, thus demonstrating
strong cross-task transferability. However, these models still face challenges
in generalization and robustness when encountering novel anatomical structures,
varying imaging conditions, or unseen modalities. To address these limitations,
this paper incorporates Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) into foundation
models to enhance their generalization and robustness in medical image
registration. By optimizing the flatness of the loss landscape, SAM improves
model stability across diverse data distributions and strengthens its ability
to handle complex clinical scenarios. Experimental results show that foundation
models integrated with SAM achieve significant improvements in cross-dataset
registration performance, offering new insights for the advancement of medical
image registration technology. Our code is available at

Conclusion: TACFN通过自适应特征选择和强化，有效解决了跨模态融合中的冗余和互补问题，提升了情感识别效果。

Abstract: The fusion technique is the key to the multimodal emotion recognition task.
Recently, cross-modal attention-based fusion methods have demonstrated high
performance and strong robustness. However, cross-modal attention suffers from
redundant features and does not capture complementary features well. We find
that it is not necessary to use the entire information of one modality to
reinforce the other during cross-modal interaction, and the features that can
reinforce a modality may contain only a part of it. To this end, we design an
innovative Transformer-based Adaptive Cross-modal Fusion Network (TACFN).
Specifically, for the redundant features, we make one modality perform
intra-modal feature selection through a self-attention mechanism, so that the
selected features can adaptively and efficiently interact with another
modality. To better capture the complementary information between the
modalities, we obtain the fused weight vector by splicing and use the weight
vector to achieve feature reinforcement of the modalities. We apply TCAFN to
the RAVDESS and IEMOCAP datasets. For fair comparison, we use the same unimodal
representations to validate the effectiveness of the proposed fusion method.
The experimental results show that TACFN brings a significant performance
improvement compared to other methods and reaches the state-of-the-art. All

Conclusion: ProFashion通过多参考图像和运动优化显著提升了时尚视频生成的视图和运动一致性。

Abstract: Fashion video generation aims to synthesize temporally consistent videos from
reference images of a designated character. Despite significant progress,
existing diffusion-based methods only support a single reference image as
input, severely limiting their capability to generate view-consistent fashion
videos, especially when there are different patterns on the clothes from
different perspectives. Moreover, the widely adopted motion module does not
sufficiently model human body movement, leading to sub-optimal spatiotemporal
consistency. To address these issues, we propose ProFashion, a fashion video
generation framework leveraging multiple reference images to achieve improved
view consistency and temporal coherency. To effectively leverage features from
multiple reference images while maintaining a reasonable computational cost, we
devise a Pose-aware Prototype Aggregator, which selects and aggregates global
and fine-grained reference features according to pose information to form
frame-wise prototypes, which serve as guidance in the denoising process. To
further enhance motion consistency, we introduce a Flow-enhanced Prototype
Instantiator, which exploits the human keypoint motion flow to guide an extra
spatiotemporal attention process in the denoiser. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of ProFashion, we extensively evaluate our method on the
MRFashion-7K dataset we collected from the Internet. ProFashion also
outperforms previous methods on the UBC Fashion dataset.

Abstract: Visual text rendering, which aims to accurately integrate specified textual
content within generated images, is critical for various applications such as
commercial design. Despite recent advances, current methods struggle with
long-tail text cases, particularly when handling unseen or small-sized text. In
this work, we propose a novel Hierarchical Disentangled Glyph-Based framework
(HDGlyph) that hierarchically decouples text generation from non-text visual
synthesis, enabling joint optimization of both common and long-tail text
rendering. At the training stage, HDGlyph disentangles pixel-level
representations via the Multi-Linguistic GlyphNet and the Glyph-Aware
Perceptual Loss, ensuring robust rendering even for unseen characters. At
inference time, HDGlyph applies Noise-Disentangled Classifier-Free Guidance and
Latent-Disentangled Two-Stage Rendering (LD-TSR) scheme, which refines both
background and small-sized text. Extensive evaluations show our model
consistently outperforms others, with 5.08% and 11.7% accuracy gains in English
and Chinese text rendering while maintaining high image quality. It also excels
in long-tail scenarios with strong accuracy and visual performance.

Conclusion: PSM框架通过挖掘正样本和优化损失函数，显著提升了弱监督时间句子定位任务的性能。

Abstract: The task of weakly supervised temporal sentence grounding (WSTSG) aims to
detect temporal intervals corresponding to a language description from
untrimmed videos with only video-level video-language correspondence. For an
anchor sample, most existing approaches generate negative samples either from
other videos or within the same video for contrastive learning. However, some
training samples are highly similar to the anchor sample, directly regarding
them as negative samples leads to difficulties for optimization and ignores the
correlations between these similar samples and the anchor sample. To address
this, we propose Positive Sample Mining (PSM), a novel framework that mines
positive samples from the training set to provide more discriminative
supervision. Specifically, for a given anchor sample, we partition the
remaining training set into semantically similar and dissimilar subsets based
on the similarity of their text queries. To effectively leverage these
correlations, we introduce a PSM-guided contrastive loss to ensure that the
anchor proposal is closer to similar samples and further from dissimilar ones.
Additionally, we design a PSM-guided rank loss to ensure that similar samples
are closer to the anchor proposal than to the negative intra-video proposal,
aiming to distinguish the anchor proposal and the negative intra-video
proposal. Experiments on the WSTSG and grounded VideoQA tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our method.

noise, particularly mismatched pairs, which degrade retrieval performance.
Existing methods often focus on negative samples, amplifying this noise. To
address these issues, we propose the Dynamic Uncertainty and Relational
Alignment (DURA) framework, which includes the Key Feature Selector (KFS) and a
new loss function, Dynamic Softmax Hinge Loss (DSH-Loss). KFS captures and
models noise uncertainty, improving retrieval reliability. The bidirectional
evidence from cross-modal similarity is modeled as a Dirichlet distribution,
enhancing adaptability to noisy data. DSH adjusts the difficulty of negative
samples to improve robustness in noisy environments. Our experiments on three
datasets show that the method offers strong noise resistance and improves
retrieval performance in both low- and high-noise scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前传感器方法在电力传输线距离测量中难以平衡精度与成本，现有摄像头缺乏深度信息，3D激光成本过高。

Method: 提出ElectricSight系统框架，结合实时图像和点云先验，采用单目深度估计方法提升性能。

Result: 实验显示系统平均测量精度1.08米，预警准确率92%。

Conclusion: ElectricSight提供了一种经济高效的解决方案，显著提升了电力传输线监测的精度和可靠性。

Abstract: Protecting power transmission lines from potential hazards involves critical
tasks, one of which is the accurate measurement of distances between power
lines and potential threats, such as large cranes. The challenge with this task
is that the current sensor-based methods face challenges in balancing accuracy
and cost in distance measurement. A common practice is to install cameras on
transmission towers, which, however, struggle to measure true 3D distances due
to the lack of depth information. Although 3D lasers can provide accurate depth
data, their high cost makes large-scale deployment impractical.
  To address this challenge, we present ElectricSight, a system designed for 3D
distance measurement and monitoring of potential hazards to power transmission
lines. This work's key innovations lie in both the overall system framework and
a monocular depth estimation method. Specifically, the system framework
combines real-time images with environmental point cloud priors, enabling
cost-effective and precise 3D distance measurements. As a core component of the
system, the monocular depth estimation method enhances the performance by
integrating 3D point cloud data into image-based estimates, improving both the
accuracy and reliability of the system.
  To assess ElectricSight's performance, we conducted tests with data from a
real-world power transmission scenario. The experimental results demonstrate
that ElectricSight achieves an average accuracy of 1.08 m for distance
measurements and an early warning accuracy of 92%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖参数化人体模型（如SMPL），缺乏对几何结构的考虑，限制了泛化能力。GRACE旨在通过几何级推理解决这一问题。

Method: GRACE采用点云编码-解码架构和分层特征提取模块，结合3D几何结构与2D图像语义，建立几何特征到顶点空间的隐式映射。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，GRACE实现了最先进的性能，并展示了其对非结构化人体点云的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: GRACE通过几何级推理显著提升了3D人-场景接触估计的精度和泛化能力，为相关应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Estimating the geometry level of human-scene contact aims to ground specific
contact surface points at 3D human geometries, which provides a spatial prior
and bridges the interaction between human and scene, supporting applications
such as human behavior analysis, embodied AI, and AR/VR. To complete the task,
existing approaches predominantly rely on parametric human models (e.g., SMPL),
which establish correspondences between images and contact regions through
fixed SMPL vertex sequences. This actually completes the mapping from image
features to an ordered sequence. However, this approach lacks consideration of
geometry, limiting its generalizability in distinct human geometries. In this
paper, we introduce GRACE (Geometry-level Reasoning for 3D Human-scene Contact
Estimation), a new paradigm for 3D human contact estimation. GRACE incorporates
a point cloud encoder-decoder architecture along with a hierarchical feature
extraction and fusion module, enabling the effective integration of 3D human
geometric structures with 2D interaction semantics derived from images. Guided
by visual cues, GRACE establishes an implicit mapping from geometric features
to the vertex space of the 3D human mesh, thereby achieving accurate modeling
of contact regions. This design ensures high prediction accuracy and endows the
framework with strong generalization capability across diverse human
geometries. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that GRACE achieves state-of-the-art performance in contact estimation, with
additional results further validating its robust generalization to unstructured
human point clouds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于获取真实高分辨率图像的困难，限制了深度学习在图像融合中的实际应用。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段通过Degradation-Aware Modeling (DAM)和预热过程捕获降分辨率映射并减少训练时间；第二阶段通过Random Alternation Optimization (RAO)结合降分辨率和全分辨率图像优化模型。

Result: 实验表明，TRA-PAN在定量指标和视觉质量上均优于现有方法，且仅需单对图像即可实现零样本训练。

Conclusion: TRA-PAN具有强实用性，解决了数据需求问题，并在实际场景中表现优异。

Abstract: In recent years, pansharpening has seen rapid advancements with deep learning
methods, which have demonstrated impressive fusion quality. However, the
challenge of acquiring real high-resolution images limits the practical
applicability of these methods. To address this, we propose a two-stage random
alternating framework (TRA-PAN) that effectively integrates strong supervision
constraints from reduced-resolution images with the physical characteristics of
full-resolution images. The first stage introduces a pre-training procedure,
which includes Degradation-Aware Modeling (DAM) to capture spatial-spectral
degradation mappings, alongside a warm-up procedure designed to reduce training
time and mitigate the negative effects of reduced-resolution data. In the
second stage, Random Alternation Optimization (RAO) is employed, where random
alternating training leverages the strengths of both reduced- and
full-resolution images, further optimizing the fusion model. By primarily
relying on full-resolution images, our method enables zero-shot training with
just a single image pair, obviating the need for large datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that TRA-PAN outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in
both quantitative metrics and visual quality in real-world scenarios,
highlighting its strong practical applicability.

Conclusion: LST层为设计紧凑高效的神经网络提供了新方法，适合硬件实现。

Abstract: The paper presents a learned two-dimensional separable transform (LST) that
can be considered as a new type of computational layer for constructing neural
network (NN) architecture for image recognition tasks. The LST based on the
idea of sharing the weights of one fullyconnected (FC) layer to process all
rows of an image. After that, a second shared FC layer is used to process all
columns of image representation obtained from the first layer. The use of LST
layers in a NN architecture significantly reduces the number of model
parameters compared to models that use stacked FC layers. We show that a
NN-classifier based on a single LST layer followed by an FC layer achieves
98.02\% accuracy on the MNIST dataset, while having only 9.5k parameters. We
also implemented a LST-based classifier for handwritten digit recognition on
the FPGA platform to demonstrate the efficiency of the suggested approach for
designing a compact and high-performance implementation of NN models. Git

Abstract: This paper proposes batch augmentation with unimodal fine-tuning to detect
the fetus's organs from ultrasound images and associated clinical textual
information. We also prescribe pre-training initial layers with investigated
medical data before the multimodal training. At first, we apply a transferred
initialization with the unimodal image portion of the dataset with batch
augmentation. This step adjusts the initial layer weights for medical data.
Then, we apply neural networks (NNs) with fine-tuned initial layers to images
in batches with batch augmentation to obtain features. We also extract
information from descriptions of images. We combine this information with
features obtained from images to train the head layer. We write a dataloader
script to load the multimodal data and use existing unimodal image augmentation
techniques with batch augmentation for the multimodal data. The dataloader
brings a new random augmentation for each batch to get a good generalization.
We investigate the FPU23 ultrasound and UPMC Food-101 multimodal datasets. The
multimodal large language model (LLM) with the proposed training provides the
best results among the investigated methods. We receive near state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on the UPMC Food-101 dataset. We share the scripts of the
proposed method with traditional counterparts at the following repository:

Motivation: 持续异常检测面临灾难性遗忘和像素级细节特征丢失的挑战，现有方法无法有效保留细节。

Method: 通过预训练扩散模型的语义嵌入和空间特征，生成高质量历史数据重放，保留像素级细节并提升多样性。

Result: 在VisA和MVTec数据集上，分割性能分别提升11.5%和8.1%，达到SOTA。

Conclusion: ReplayCAD通过生成重放有效解决了持续异常检测的关键问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Continual Anomaly Detection (CAD) enables anomaly detection models in
learning new classes while preserving knowledge of historical classes. CAD
faces two key challenges: catastrophic forgetting and segmentation of small
anomalous regions. Existing CAD methods store image distributions or patch
features to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, but they fail to preserve
pixel-level detailed features for accurate segmentation. To overcome this
limitation, we propose ReplayCAD, a novel diffusion-driven generative replay
framework that replay high-quality historical data, thus effectively preserving
pixel-level detailed features. Specifically, we compress historical data by
searching for a class semantic embedding in the conditional space of the
pre-trained diffusion model, which can guide the model to replay data with
fine-grained pixel details, thus improving the segmentation performance.
However, relying solely on semantic features results in limited spatial
diversity. Hence, we further use spatial features to guide data compression,
achieving precise control of sample space, thereby generating more diverse
data. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both classification
and segmentation, with notable improvements in segmentation: 11.5% on VisA and
8.1% on MVTec. Our source code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解单模态主导，提升多模态学习的平衡性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Fusing and balancing multi-modal inputs from novel sensors for dense
prediction tasks, particularly semantic segmentation, is critically important
yet remains a significant challenge. One major limitation is the tendency of
multi-modal frameworks to over-rely on easily learnable modalities, a
phenomenon referred to as unimodal dominance or bias. This issue becomes
especially problematic in real-world scenarios where the dominant modality may
be unavailable, resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we
apply a simple but effective plug-and-play regularization term based on
functional entropy, which introduces no additional parameters or modules. This
term is designed to intuitively balance the contribution of each visual
modality to the segmentation results. Specifically, we leverage the log-Sobolev
inequality to bound functional entropy using functional-Fisher-information. By
maximizing the information contributed by each visual modality, our approach
mitigates unimodal dominance and establishes a more balanced and robust
segmentation framework. A multi-scale regularization module is proposed to
apply our proposed plug-and-play term on high-level features and also
segmentation predictions for more balanced multi-modal learning. Extensive
experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
superior performance, i.e., +13.94%, +3.25%, and +3.64%, without introducing
any additional parameters.

Conclusion: 该方法在数据集蒸馏任务中表现出广泛的适用性和高效性。

Abstract: As deep learning models grow in complexity and the volume of training data
increases, reducing storage and computational costs becomes increasingly
important. Dataset distillation addresses this challenge by synthesizing a
compact set of synthetic data that can effectively replace the original dataset
in downstream classification tasks. While existing methods typically rely on
mapping data from pixel space to the latent space of a generative model, we
propose a novel stochastic approach that models the joint distribution of
latent features. This allows our method to better capture spatial structures
and produce diverse synthetic samples, which benefits model training.
Specifically, we introduce a low-rank multivariate normal distribution
parameterized by a lightweight network. This design maintains low computational
complexity and is compatible with various matching networks used in dataset
distillation. After distillation, synthetic images are generated by feeding the
learned latent features into a pretrained generator. These synthetic images are
then used to train classification models, and performance is evaluated on real
test set. We validate our method on several benchmarks, including ImageNet
subsets, CIFAR-10, and the MedMNIST histopathological dataset. Our approach
achieves state-of-the-art cross architecture performance across a range of
backbone architectures, demonstrating its generality and effectiveness.

Conclusion: METOR框架通过联合建模和相互增强，显著提升了开放词汇视频视觉关系检测的性能。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary video visual relationship detection aims to detect objects
and their relationships in videos without being restricted by predefined object
or relationship categories. Existing methods leverage the rich semantic
knowledge of pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP to identify novel
categories. They typically adopt a cascaded pipeline to first detect objects
and then classify relationships based on the detected objects, which may lead
to error propagation and thus suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose
Mutual EnhancemenT of Objects and Relationships (METOR), a query-based unified
framework to jointly model and mutually enhance object detection and
relationship classification in open-vocabulary scenarios. Under this framework,
we first design a CLIP-based contextual refinement encoding module that
extracts visual contexts of objects and relationships to refine the encoding of
text features and object queries, thus improving the generalization of encoding
to novel categories. Then we propose an iterative enhancement module to
alternatively enhance the representations of objects and relationships by fully
exploiting their interdependence to improve recognition performance. Extensive
experiments on two public datasets, VidVRD and VidOR, demonstrate that our
framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MultiTaskVIF提供了一种简洁高效的解决方案，直接整合语义信息到融合模型中。

Abstract: Visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) has attracted significant attention
in recent years. Traditional VIF methods primarily focus on generating fused
images with high visual quality, while recent advancements increasingly
emphasize incorporating semantic information into the fusion model during
training. However, most existing segmentation-oriented VIF methods adopt a
cascade structure comprising separate fusion and segmentation models, leading
to increased network complexity and redundancy. This raises a critical
question: can we design a more concise and efficient structure to integrate
semantic information directly into the fusion model during training-Inspired by
multi-task learning, we propose a concise and universal training framework,
MultiTaskVIF, for segmentation-oriented VIF models. In this framework, we
introduce a multi-task head decoder (MTH) to simultaneously output both the
fused image and the segmentation result during training. Unlike previous
cascade training frameworks that necessitate joint training with a complete
segmentation model, MultiTaskVIF enables the fusion model to learn semantic
features by simply replacing its decoder with MTH. Extensive experimental
evaluations validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code will be
released upon acceptance.

Abstract: We present StableMotion, a novel framework leverages knowledge (geometry and
content priors) from pretrained large-scale image diffusion models to perform
motion estimation, solving single-image-based image rectification tasks such as
Stitched Image Rectangling (SIR) and Rolling Shutter Correction (RSC).
Specifically, StableMotion framework takes text-to-image Stable Diffusion (SD)
models as backbone and repurposes it into an image-to-motion estimator. To
mitigate inconsistent output produced by diffusion models, we propose Adaptive
Ensemble Strategy (AES) that consolidates multiple outputs into a cohesive,
high-fidelity result. Additionally, we present the concept of Sampling Steps
Disaster (SSD), the counterintuitive scenario where increasing the number of
sampling steps can lead to poorer outcomes, which enables our framework to
achieve one-step inference. StableMotion is verified on two image rectification
tasks and delivers state-of-the-art performance in both, as well as showing
strong generalizability. Supported by SSD, StableMotion offers a speedup of 200
times compared to previous diffusion model-based methods.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid expansion of dataset sizes and the increasing
complexity of deep learning models have significantly escalated the demand for
computational resources, both for data storage and model training. Dataset
distillation has emerged as a promising solution to address this challenge by
generating a compact synthetic dataset that retains the essential information
from a large real dataset. However, existing methods often suffer from limited
performance and poor data quality, particularly in the video domain. In this
paper, we focus on video dataset distillation by employing a video diffusion
model to generate high-quality synthetic videos. To enhance representativeness,
we introduce Video Spatio-Temporal U-Net (VST-UNet), a model designed to select
a diverse and informative subset of videos that effectively captures the
characteristics of the original dataset. To further optimize computational
efficiency, we explore a training-free clustering algorithm, Temporal-Aware
Cluster-based Distillation (TAC-DT), to select representative videos without
requiring additional training overhead. We validate the effectiveness of our
approach through extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets,
demonstrating performance improvements of up to \(10.61\%\) over the
state-of-the-art. Our method consistently outperforms existing approaches
across all datasets, establishing a new benchmark for video dataset
distillation.

Abstract: Text-to-video generative models have achieved significant progress, driven by
the rapid advancements in diffusion models, with notable examples including
Pika, Luma, Kling, and Sora. Despite their remarkable generation ability, their
vulnerability to jailbreak attack, i.e. to generate unsafe content, including
pornography, violence, and discrimination, raises serious safety concerns.
Existing efforts, such as T2VSafetyBench, have provided valuable benchmarks for
evaluating the safety of text-to-video models against unsafe prompts but lack
systematic studies for exploiting their vulnerabilities effectively. In this
paper, we propose the \textit{first} optimization-based jailbreak attack
against text-to-video models, which is specifically designed. Our approach
formulates the prompt generation task as an optimization problem with three key
objectives: (1) maximizing the semantic similarity between the input and
generated prompts, (2) ensuring that the generated prompts can evade the safety
filter of the text-to-video model, and (3) maximizing the semantic similarity
between the generated videos and the original input prompts. To further enhance
the robustness of the generated prompts, we introduce a prompt mutation
strategy that creates multiple prompt variants in each iteration, selecting the
most effective one based on the averaged score. This strategy not only improves
the attack success rate but also boosts the semantic relevance of the generated
video. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple text-to-video models,
including Open-Sora, Pika, Luma, and Kling. The results demonstrate that our
method not only achieves a higher attack success rate compared to baseline
methods but also generates videos with greater semantic similarity to the
original input prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DUN方法在IDIR任务中性能不足，主要原因是未充分探索展开结构的潜力，包括任务特定模型构建、网络架构集成和损失函数设计。

Method: 提出UnfoldIR方法，包括IDIR专用模型、多阶段网络（RAIC和IGRE模块）和跨阶段信息一致损失函数。

Result: 实验验证了UnfoldIR在5个IDIR任务和3个下游问题中的有效性。

Conclusion: UnfoldIR通过优化展开结构和损失设计，显著提升了DUN在IDIR任务中的性能。

Abstract: Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) are widely employed in illumination
degradation image restoration (IDIR) to merge the interpretability of
model-based approaches with the generalization of learning-based methods.
However, the performance of DUN-based methods remains considerably inferior to
that of state-of-the-art IDIR solvers. Our investigation indicates that this
limitation does not stem from structural shortcomings of DUNs but rather from
the limited exploration of the unfolding structure, particularly for (1)
constructing task-specific restoration models, (2) integrating advanced network
architectures, and (3) designing DUN-specific loss functions. To address these
issues, we propose a novel DUN-based method, UnfoldIR, for IDIR tasks. UnfoldIR
first introduces a new IDIR model with dedicated regularization terms for
smoothing illumination and enhancing texture. We unfold the iterative optimized
solution of this model into a multistage network, with each stage comprising a
reflectance-assisted illumination correction (RAIC) module and an
illumination-guided reflectance enhancement (IGRE) module. RAIC employs a
visual state space (VSS) to extract non-local features, enforcing illumination
smoothness, while IGRE introduces a frequency-aware VSS to globally align
similar textures, enabling mildly degraded regions to guide the enhancement of
details in more severely degraded areas. This suppresses noise while enhancing
details. Furthermore, given the multistage structure, we propose an inter-stage
information consistent loss to maintain network stability in the final stages.
This loss contributes to structural preservation and sustains the model's
performance even in unsupervised settings. Experiments verify our effectiveness
across 5 IDIR tasks and 3 downstream problems.

Result: 实验结果表明FNBench的有效性，并揭示了噪声标签对联邦学习的影响。

Conclusion: FNBench为联邦学习中的标签噪声问题提供了基准和解决方案，同时指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Robustness to label noise within data is a significant challenge in federated
learning (FL). From the data-centric perspective, the data quality of
distributed datasets can not be guaranteed since annotations of different
clients contain complicated label noise of varying degrees, which causes the
performance degradation. There have been some early attempts to tackle noisy
labels in FL. However, there exists a lack of benchmark studies on
comprehensively evaluating their practical performance under unified settings.
To this end, we propose the first benchmark study FNBench to provide an
experimental investigation which considers three diverse label noise patterns
covering synthetic label noise, imperfect human-annotation errors and
systematic errors. Our evaluation incorporates eighteen state-of-the-art
methods over five image recognition datasets and one text classification
dataset. Meanwhile, we provide observations to understand why noisy labels
impair FL, and additionally exploit a representation-aware regularization
method to enhance the robustness of existing methods against noisy labels based
on our observations. Finally, we discuss the limitations of this work and
propose three-fold future directions. To facilitate related communities, our
source code is open-sourced at https://github.com/Sprinter1999/FNBench.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为NAS-DETR的架构，结合了DETR和NAS方法，用于提升声纳图像中的目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 声纳图像分辨率低且特征稀疏，导致目标检测性能下降，需优化方法。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能，同时保持低计算开销和实时性。

Conclusion: 首次将DETR与NAS结合用于声纳目标检测，性能显著提升且具可解释性。

Abstract: Underwater object detection using sonar imagery has become a critical and
rapidly evolving research domain within marine technology. However, sonar
images are characterized by lower resolution and sparser features compared to
optical images, which seriously degrades the performance of object detection.To
address these challenges, we specifically propose a Detection Transformer
(DETR) architecture optimized with a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approach
called NAS-DETR for object detection in sonar images. First, an improved
Zero-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method based on the maximum entropy
principle is proposed to identify a real-time, high-representational-capacity
CNN-Transformer backbone for sonar image detection. This method enables the
efficient discovery of high-performance network architectures with low
computational and time overhead. Subsequently, the backbone is combined with a
Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a deformable attention-based Transformer
decoder to construct a complete network architecture. This architecture
integrates various advanced components and training schemes to enhance overall
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this architecture achieves
state-of-the-art performance on two Representative datasets, while maintaining
minimal overhead in real-time efficiency and computational complexity.
Furthermore, correlation analysis between the key parameters and differential
entropy-based fitness function is performed to enhance the interpretability of
the proposed framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in
the field of sonar object detection to integrate the DETR architecture with a
NAS search mechanism.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 本文提出了一种弱监督预训练方法，用于多实例学习（MIL）中的特征提取器，通过将弱标签从包级传播到实例级进行监督学习，提升了WSI数据集的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIL方法忽视了实例级表示学习，依赖预训练特征提取器，但这种方法并不总是可行。

Method: 采用弱监督方案预训练特征提取器，结合数据增强、非线性预测头和鲁棒损失函数。

Result: 在多个WSI数据集上表现优于其他预训练方案（如ImageNet预训练和自监督学习）。

Conclusion: 这是首个专注于MIL表示学习的工作，展示了方法的兼容性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Various multi-instance learning (MIL) based approaches have been developed
and successfully applied to whole-slide pathological images (WSI). Existing MIL
methods emphasize the importance of feature aggregators, but largely neglect
the instance-level representation learning. They assume that the availability
of a pre-trained feature extractor can be directly utilized or fine-tuned,
which is not always the case. This paper proposes to pre-train feature
extractor for MIL via a weakly-supervised scheme, i.e., propagating the weak
bag-level labels to the corresponding instances for supervised learning. To
learn effective features for MIL, we further delve into several key components,
including strong data augmentation, a non-linear prediction head and the robust
loss function. We conduct experiments on common large-scale WSI datasets and
find it achieves better performance than other pre-training schemes (e.g.,
ImageNet pre-training and self-supervised learning) in different downstream
tasks. We further show the compatibility and scalability of the proposed scheme
by deploying it in fine-tuning the pathological-specific models and
pre-training on merged multiple datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first
work focusing on the representation learning for MIL.

*Parth Padalkar,Gopal Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 提出了一种从Vision Transformers（ViTs）中提取符号规则的方法，通过引入稀疏概念层和逻辑编程算法，提高了分类准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前神经符号方法在CNN上成功提取符号规则，但ViTs因其缺乏模块化概念检测器和全局自注意力机制而难以应用类似技术。

Method: 引入稀疏概念层（受稀疏自编码器启发），结合L1稀疏性、熵最小化和监督对比损失，生成二值化概念激活，再通过FOLD-SE-M算法生成逻辑程序。

Result: 分类准确率比标准ViT提高5.14%，提取的规则集可直接用于逻辑决策，程序简洁且语义明确。

Conclusion: 首次从ViTs中提取可执行的逻辑程序，填补了基于Transformer的视觉模型与符号逻辑编程之间的空白，推动了可解释和可验证的神经符号AI的发展。

Abstract: Recent neuro-symbolic approaches have successfully extracted symbolic
rule-sets from CNN-based models to enhance interpretability. However, applying
similar techniques to Vision Transformers (ViTs) remains challenging due to
their lack of modular concept detectors and reliance on global self-attention
mechanisms. We propose a framework for symbolic rule extraction from ViTs by
introducing a sparse concept layer inspired by Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). This
linear layer operates on attention-weighted patch representations and learns a
disentangled, binarized representation in which individual neurons activate for
high-level visual concepts. To encourage interpretability, we apply a
combination of L1 sparsity, entropy minimization, and supervised contrastive
loss. These binarized concept activations are used as input to the FOLD-SE-M
algorithm, which generates a rule-set in the form of logic programs. Our method
achieves a 5.14% better classification accuracy than the standard ViT while
enabling symbolic reasoning. Crucially, the extracted rule-set is not merely
post-hoc but acts as a logic-based decision layer that operates directly on the
sparse concept representations. The resulting programs are concise and
semantically meaningful. This work is the first to extract executable logic
programs from ViTs using sparse symbolic representations. It bridges the gap
between transformer-based vision models and symbolic logic programming,
providing a step forward in interpretable and verifiable neuro-symbolic AI.

Result: 在主流和自建数据集上验证了模型的优越性。

Conclusion: SDML模型在多模态假新闻检测中表现出色，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Multimodal news contains a wealth of information and is easily affected by
deepfake modeling attacks. To combat the latest image and text generation
methods, we present a new Multimodal Fake News Detection dataset (MFND)
containing 11 manipulated types, designed to detect and localize highly
authentic fake news. Furthermore, we propose a Shallow-Deep Multitask Learning
(SDML) model for fake news, which fully uses unimodal and mutual modal features
to mine the intrinsic semantics of news. Under shallow inference, we propose
the momentum distillation-based light punishment contrastive learning for
fine-grained uniform spatial image and text semantic alignment, and an adaptive
cross-modal fusion module to enhance mutual modal features. Under deep
inference, we design a two-branch framework to augment the image and text
unimodal features, respectively merging with mutual modalities features, for
four predictions via dedicated detection and localization projections.
Experiments on both mainstream and our proposed datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the model. Codes and dataset are released at
https://github.com/yunan-wang33/sdml.

*Thien Nhan Vo*

TLDR: 通过主动学习减少图像分类所需的训练样本数量，利用不确定性度量选择高价值样本，在MNIST和Fruits360数据集上验证效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分类通常需要大量训练样本，主动学习能通过策略性选择样本减少需求。

Method: 使用四种不确定性度量对图像样本赋值，选择高价值样本训练CNN分类器。

Result: 在MNIST和Fruits360数据集上验证了主动学习的有效性，尤其在复杂任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 主动学习是图像分类问题的可行算法，尤其在复杂任务中效果显著。

Abstract: A principle bottleneck in image classification is the large number of
training examples needed to train a classifier. Using active learning, we can
reduce the number of training examples to teach a CNN classifier by
strategically selecting examples. Assigning values to image examples using
different uncertainty metrics allows the model to identify and select
high-value examples in a smaller training set size. We demonstrate results for
digit recognition and fruit classification on the MNIST and Fruits360 data
sets. We formally compare results for four different uncertainty metrics.
Finally, we observe active learning is also effective on simpler (binary)
classification tasks, but marked improvement from random sampling is more
evident on more difficult tasks. We show active learning is a viable algorithm
for image classification problems.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新方法BEO和FG-CCDB，用于解决数据中虚假相关性问题，无需依赖偏差标注，通过更精细的分布建模和匹配提升泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚假相关性在无偏差标注的情况下难以解决，现有方法CCDB假设过于简化，无法适应真实场景。

Method: 提出BEO方法，通过潜在群组建模更精细地捕捉分布；基于此提出FG-CCDB，实现群组级别的分布匹配和平衡。

Result: BEO可作为偏差标注的强代理，FG-CCDB在二元分类任务中表现与监督方法相当，在多类任务中显著优于监督方法。

Conclusion: BEO和FG-CCDB有效解决了虚假相关性，无需标注且计算高效，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Achieving group-robust generalization in the presence of spurious
correlations remains a significant challenge, particularly when bias
annotations are unavailable. Recent studies on Class-Conditional Distribution
Balancing (CCDB) reveal that spurious correlations often stem from mismatches
between the class-conditional and marginal distributions of bias attributes.
They achieve promising results by addressing this issue through simple
distribution matching in a bias-agnostic manner. However, CCDB approximates
each distribution using a single Gaussian, which is overly simplistic and
rarely holds in real-world applications. To address this limitation, we propose
a novel method called Bias Exploration via Overfitting (BEO), which captures
each distribution in greater detail by modeling it as a mixture of latent
groups. Building on these group-level descriptions, we introduce a fine-grained
variant of CCDB, termed FG-CCDB, which performs more precise distribution
matching and balancing within each group. Through group-level reweighting,
FG-CCDB learns sample weights from a global perspective, achieving stronger
mitigation of spurious correlations without incurring substantial storage or
computational costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BEO serves as a
strong proxy for ground-truth bias annotations and can be seamlessly integrated
with bias-supervised methods. Moreover, when combined with FG-CCDB, our method
performs on par with bias-supervised approaches on binary classification tasks
and significantly outperforms them in highly biased multi-class scenarios.

TLDR: 提出了一种名为CoRoI的方法，通过识别和优先处理高分辨率图像中的关键区域，降低计算负担，同时提升多模态大语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率图像对多模态大语言模型至关重要，但直接提高分辨率会增加计算成本。

Method: 受人类视觉系统启发，CoRoI选择性地处理图像中的关键区域，避免处理全部高分辨率图像数据。

Result: 在11个基准测试中验证了CoRoI的有效性，性能优于LLaVA-NeXT和部分专有模型。

Conclusion: CoRoI是一种高效的方法，能够在降低计算成本的同时提升多模态任务的性能。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) images are pivotal for enhancing the recognition and
understanding capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs).
However, directly increasing image resolution can significantly escalate
computational demands. In this study, we propose a method called Chain of
Region-of-Interest (CoRoI) for Visual Instruction Tuning, aimed at alleviating
the computational burden associated with high-resolution images for MLLMs.
Drawing inspiration from the selective nature of the human visual system, we
recognize that not all regions within high-resolution images carry equal
importance. CoRoI seeks to identify and prioritize the most informative
regions, thereby enhancing multimodal visual comprehension and recognition
while circumventing the need for processing lengthy HR image tokens. Through
extensive experiments on 11 benchmarks, we validate the efficacy of CoRoI
across varying sizes, ranging from 7B to 34B in parameters. Our models
consistently demonstrate superior performance across diverse multimodal
benchmarks and tasks. Notably, our method outperforms LLaVA-NeXT on almost all
benchmarks and our finetuned 34B model surpasses proprietary methods like
Gemini Pro 1.0 on six benchmarks, as well as outperforming GPT-4V on MMB,
SEED-I, and MME.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拉丁美洲癌症病例数量预计将大幅增加，骨肉瘤作为常见且致命的骨癌，手术切除需要精确的安全边界以确保完全切除并保留健康组织。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法有望实现自动化和个性化的安全边界确定。

Conclusion: 该方法为骨肉瘤手术提供了潜在的高效、精准的安全边界估计工具。

Abstract: According to the Pan American Health Organization, the number of cancer cases
in Latin America was estimated at 4.2 million in 2022 and is projected to rise
to 6.7 million by 2045. Osteosarcoma, one of the most common and deadly bone
cancers affecting young people, is difficult to detect due to its unique
texture and intensity. Surgical removal of osteosarcoma requires precise safety
margins to ensure complete resection while preserving healthy tissue.
Therefore, this study proposes a method for estimating the confidence interval
of surgical safety margins in osteosarcoma surgery around the knee. The
proposed approach uses MRI and X-ray data from open-source repositories,
digital processing techniques, and unsupervised learning algorithms (such as
k-means clustering) to define tumor boundaries. Experimental results highlight
the potential for automated, patient-specific determination of safety margins.

<details>

Motivation: 现有文本识别方法依赖合成数据，但合成数据无法复现实世界复杂场景（如光照不均、遮挡等），导致性能差距。自监督学习（如对比学习和MIM）试图缩小这一差距。

Method: 引入随机块和跨度掩码策略，结合随机补丁掩码，形成MMS框架，以学习高低级文本特征。

Result: MMS在文本识别、分割和超分辨率等任务中表现优于现有自监督方法。

Conclusion: MMS通过多掩码策略有效提升了文本识别任务中的特征学习能力，适用于复杂现实场景。

Abstract: Most existing text recognition methods are trained on large-scale synthetic
datasets due to the scarcity of labeled real-world datasets. Synthetic images,
however, cannot faithfully reproduce real-world scenarios, such as uneven
illumination, irregular layout, occlusion, and degradation, resulting in
performance disparities when handling complex real-world images. Recent
self-supervised learning techniques, notably contrastive learning and masked
image modeling (MIM), narrow this domain gap by exploiting unlabeled real text
images. This study first analyzes the original Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) and
observes that random patch masking predominantly captures low-level textural
features but misses high-level contextual representations. To fully exploit the
high-level contextual representations, we introduce random blockwise and span
masking in the text recognition task. These strategies can mask the continuous
image patches and completely remove some characters, forcing the model to infer
relationships among characters within a word. Our Multi-Masking Strategy (MMS)
integrates random patch, blockwise, and span masking into the MIM frame, which
jointly learns low and high-level textual representations. After fine-tuning
with real data, MMS outperforms the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods in
various text-related tasks, including text recognition, segmentation, and
text-image super-resolution.

Result: SDNP可用于追踪不同iPhone型号和iOS版本的图像，并在PRNU验证中显著减少误报。

Conclusion: SDNP的表征和应用改进了相机源验证技术，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: iPhone portrait-mode images contain a distinctive pattern in out-of-focus
regions simulating the bokeh effect, which we term Apple's Synthetic Defocus
Noise Pattern (SDNP). If overlooked, this pattern can interfere with blind
forensic analyses, especially PRNU-based camera source verification, as noted
in earlier works. Since Apple's SDNP remains underexplored, we provide a
detailed characterization, proposing a method for its precise estimation,
modeling its dependence on scene brightness, ISO settings, and other factors.
Leveraging this characterization, we explore forensic applications of the SDNP,
including traceability of portrait-mode images across iPhone models and iOS
versions in open-set scenarios, assessing its robustness under post-processing.
Furthermore, we show that masking SDNP-affected regions in PRNU-based camera
source verification significantly reduces false positives, overcoming a
critical limitation in camera attribution, and improving state-of-the-art
techniques.

Abstract: Domain generalization in image classification is a crucial challenge, with
models often failing to generalize well across unseen datasets. We address this
issue by introducing a neuro-inspired Neural Response Normalization (NeuRN)
layer which draws inspiration from neurons in the mammalian visual cortex,
which aims to enhance the performance of deep learning architectures on unseen
target domains by training deep learning models on a source domain. The
performance of these models is considered as a baseline and then compared
against models integrated with NeuRN on image classification tasks. We perform
experiments across a range of deep learning architectures, including ones
derived from Neural Architecture Search and Vision Transformer. Additionally,
in order to shortlist models for our experiment from amongst the vast range of
deep neural networks available which have shown promising results, we also
propose a novel method that uses the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to compute
similarity between deep learning architectures. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of NeuRN by showing improvement against baseline in cross-domain
image classification tasks. Our framework attempts to establish a foundation

Abstract: The mouse is one of the most studied animal models in the field of systems
neuroscience. Understanding the generalized patterns and decoding the neural
representations that are evoked by the diverse range of natural scene stimuli
in the mouse visual cortex is one of the key quests in computational vision. In
recent years, significant parallels have been drawn between the primate visual
cortex and hierarchical deep neural networks. However, their generalized
efficacy in understanding mouse vision has been limited. In this study, we
investigate the functional alignment between the mouse visual cortex and deep
learning models for object classification tasks. We first introduce a
generalized representational learning strategy that uncovers a striking
resemblance between the functional mapping of the mouse visual cortex and
high-performing deep learning models on both top-down (population-level) and
bottom-up (single cell-level) scenarios. Next, this representational similarity
across the two systems is further enhanced by the addition of Neural Response
Normalization (NeuRN) layer, inspired by the activation profile of excitatory
and inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex. To test the performance effect of
NeuRN on real-world tasks, we integrate it into deep learning models and
observe significant improvements in their robustness against data shifts in
domain generalization tasks. Our work proposes a novel framework for comparing
the functional architecture of the mouse visual cortex with deep learning
models. Our findings carry broad implications for the development of advanced
AI models that draw inspiration from the mouse visual cortex, suggesting that
these models serve as valuable tools for studying the neural representations of
the mouse visual cortex and, as a result, enhancing their performance on
real-world tasks.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have significantly advanced the field of novel

leading NeRF architectures which include MVSNeRF and GeoNeRF. NeuGen extracts
the domain-invariant features, thereby enhancing the models' generalization
capabilities. It can be seamlessly integrated into NeRF architectures and
cultivates a comprehensive feature set that significantly improves accuracy and
robustness in image rendering. Through this integration, NeuGen shows improved
performance on benchmarks on diverse datasets across state-of-the-art NeRF
architectures, enabling them to generalize better across varied scenes. Our
comprehensive evaluations, both quantitative and qualitative, confirm that our
approach not only surpasses existing models in generalizability but also
markedly improves rendering quality. Our work exemplifies the potential of
merging neuroscientific principles with deep learning frameworks, setting a new

Motivation: 现有通用医疗AI系统在多模态解释性和预后能力方面不足，限制了其临床实用性。

Method: XMedGPT整合文本和视觉解释性，引入可靠性索引机制量化不确定性，并通过交互式问答评估一致性。

Result: 在141个解剖区域IoU达0.703，不确定性估计AUC为0.862，癌症预后模型性能提升26.9%。

Conclusion: XMedGPT在临床AI集成中取得显著进展，为多样化医疗应用提供可信且可扩展的支持。

Abstract: Generalist Medical AI (GMAI) systems have demonstrated expert-level
performance in biomedical perception tasks, yet their clinical utility remains
limited by inadequate multi-modal explainability and suboptimal prognostic
capabilities. Here, we present XMedGPT, a clinician-centric, multi-modal AI
assistant that integrates textual and visual interpretability to support
transparent and trustworthy medical decision-making. XMedGPT not only produces
accurate diagnostic and descriptive outputs, but also grounds referenced
anatomical sites within medical images, bridging critical gaps in
interpretability and enhancing clinician usability. To support real-world
deployment, we introduce a reliability indexing mechanism that quantifies
uncertainty through consistency-based assessment via interactive
question-answering. We validate XMedGPT across four pillars: multi-modal
interpretability, uncertainty quantification, and prognostic modeling, and
rigorous benchmarking. The model achieves an IoU of 0.703 across 141 anatomical
regions, and a Kendall's tau-b of 0.479, demonstrating strong alignment between
visual rationales and clinical outcomes. For uncertainty estimation, it attains
an AUC of 0.862 on visual question answering and 0.764 on radiology report
generation. In survival and recurrence prediction for lung and glioma cancers,
it surpasses prior leading models by 26.9%, and outperforms GPT-4o by 25.0%.
Rigorous benchmarking across 347 datasets covers 40 imaging modalities and
external validation spans 4 anatomical systems confirming exceptional
generalizability, with performance gains surpassing existing GMAI by 20.7% for
in-domain evaluation and 16.7% on 11,530 in-house data evaluation. Together,
XMedGPT represents a significant leap forward in clinician-centric AI
integration, offering trustworthy and scalable support for diverse healthcare
applications.

TLDR: CheXLearner是一个端到端框架，结合解剖区域检测、黎曼流形对齐和细粒度语义指导，显著提升医学图像分析的准确性和语义匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在医学图像与文本对齐时存在语义不匹配或依赖单一视觉信息的问题，缺乏医学语义整合。

Method: 提出Med-MAM模块，利用双曲几何对齐解剖结构并捕捉病理差异；引入区域进展描述作为监督信号。

Result: 在解剖区域进展检测中平均准确率达81.12%，F1分数80.32%；下游疾病分类AUC达91.52%。

Conclusion: CheXLearner通过多模态对齐和动态特征优化，显著优于现有方法，尤其在复杂区域表现突出。

Abstract: Temporal medical image analysis is essential for clinical decision-making,
yet existing methods either align images and text at a coarse level - causing
potential semantic mismatches - or depend solely on visual information, lacking
medical semantic integration. We present CheXLearner, the first end-to-end
framework that unifies anatomical region detection, Riemannian manifold-based
structure alignment, and fine-grained regional semantic guidance. Our proposed
Med-Manifold Alignment Module (Med-MAM) leverages hyperbolic geometry to
robustly align anatomical structures and capture pathologically meaningful
discrepancies across temporal chest X-rays. By introducing regional progression
descriptions as supervision, CheXLearner achieves enhanced cross-modal
representation learning and supports dynamic low-level feature optimization.
Experiments show that CheXLearner achieves 81.12% (+17.2%) average accuracy and
80.32% (+11.05%) F1-score on anatomical region progression detection -
substantially outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, especially in
structurally complex regions. Additionally, our model attains a 91.52% average
AUC score in downstream disease classification, validating its superior feature
representation.

*Jian Song,Hongruixuan Chen,Naoto Yokoya*

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文探讨了基于合成数据的单目高度估计（MHE）模型的局限性，发现其依赖阴影线索可能导致高度估计偏差，并提出了一种结合稀疏LiDAR数据（ICESat-2）的校正方法，显著降低了误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DEM数据成本高且地理覆盖有限，而基于合成数据的MHE模型虽表现优异，但其预测机制和可靠性尚不明确。

Method: 通过系统分析发现模型依赖阴影线索，提出两阶段校正方法：预处理ICESat-2数据，再通过随机森林细化高度估计。

Result: 在三个城市区域的实验中，平均绝对误差（MAE）分别降低了22.8%、6.9%和4.9%。

Conclusion: 阴影意识对合成数据驱动的模型至关重要，结合真实LiDAR数据可提升MHE的鲁棒性，为可靠且可扩展的3D映射铺路。

Abstract: Monocular height estimation (MHE) from very-high-resolution (VHR) remote
sensing imagery via deep learning is notoriously challenging due to the lack of
sufficient structural information. Conventional digital elevation models
(DEMs), typically derived from airborne LiDAR or multi-view stereo, remain
costly and geographically limited. Recently, models trained on synthetic data
and refined through domain adaptation have shown remarkable performance in MHE,
yet it remains unclear how these models make predictions or how reliable they
truly are. In this paper, we investigate a state-of-the-art MHE model trained
purely on synthetic data to explore where the model looks when making height
predictions. Through systematic analyses, we find that the model relies heavily
on shadow cues, a factor that can lead to overestimation or underestimation of
heights when shadows deviate from expected norms. Furthermore, the inherent
difficulty of evaluating regression tasks with the human eye underscores
additional limitations of purely synthetic training. To address these issues,
we propose a novel correction pipeline that integrates sparse, imperfect global
LiDAR measurements (ICESat-2) with deep-learning outputs to improve local
accuracy and achieve spatially consistent corrections. Our method comprises two
stages: pre-processing raw ICESat-2 data, followed by a random forest-based
approach to densely refine height estimates. Experiments in three
representative urban regions -- Saint-Omer, Tokyo, and Sao Paulo -- reveal
substantial error reductions, with mean absolute error (MAE) decreased by
22.8\%, 6.9\%, and 4.9\%, respectively. These findings highlight the critical
role of shadow awareness in synthetic data-driven models and demonstrate how
fusing imperfect real-world LiDAR data can bolster the robustness of MHE,
paving the way for more reliable and scalable 3D mapping solutions.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种高临床相关性的数据集，包含31,247个医学问答对，并附有专家验证的思维链解释，以解决医学大语言模型（LLMs）因不透明推理和缺乏临床验证数据而难以被临床采用的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学LLMs的临床采用受到其不透明推理和依赖非临床验证数据的限制，导致临床医生对其缺乏信任。

Method: 通过人机混合流程，生成并迭代优化医学问答对及思维链解释，由医学专家评分和修订，确保数据的高临床相关性。

Result: 开发了一个公开可用的数据集，支持开发具有透明和可验证推理能力的医学LLMs。

Conclusion: 该数据集为医学LLMs的发展提供了关键资源，有助于推动更安全、更可解释的医学AI。

Abstract: Despite strong performance in medical question-answering, the clinical
adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critically hampered by their opaque
'black-box' reasoning, limiting clinician trust. This challenge is compounded
by the predominant reliance of current medical LLMs on corpora from scientific
literature or synthetic data, which often lack the granular expert validation
and high clinical relevance essential for advancing their specialized medical
capabilities. To address these critical gaps, we introduce a highly clinically
relevant dataset with 31,247 medical question-answer pairs, each accompanied by
expert-validated chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations. This resource, spanning
multiple clinical domains, was curated via a scalable human-LLM hybrid
pipeline: LLM-generated rationales were iteratively reviewed, scored, and
refined by medical experts against a structured rubric, with substandard
outputs revised through human effort or guided LLM regeneration until expert
consensus. This publicly available dataset provides a vital source for the
development of medical LLMs that capable of transparent and verifiable
reasoning, thereby advancing safer and more interpretable AI in medicine.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态图像配准和融合方法缺乏真实对齐数据，影响融合质量。

Result: 在未对齐的多模态图像上验证了方法的有效性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: B-SR框架在多模态图像对齐和融合中表现出色，代码将公开。

Abstract: Acquiring accurately aligned multi-modal image pairs is fundamental for
achieving high-quality multi-modal image fusion. To address the lack of ground
truth in current multi-modal image registration and fusion methods, we propose
a novel self-supervised \textbf{B}i-directional
\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{R}egistration framework (\textbf{B-SR}). Specifically,
B-SR utilizes a proxy data generator (PDG) and an inverse proxy data generator
(IPDG) to achieve self-supervised global-local registration. Visible-infrared
image pairs with spatially misaligned differences are aligned to obtain global
differences through the registration module. The same image pairs are processed
by PDG, such as cropping, flipping, stitching, etc., and then aligned to obtain
local differences. IPDG converts the obtained local differences into
pseudo-global differences, which are used to perform global-local difference
consistency with the global differences. Furthermore, aiming at eliminating the
effect of modal gaps on the registration module, we design a neighborhood
dynamic alignment loss to achieve cross-modal image edge alignment. Extensive
experiments on misaligned multi-modal images demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method in multi-modal image alignment and fusion against the
competing methods. Our code will be publicly available.

Conclusion: TAPNet通过多模态信息融合和数据增强，显著提升了人群计数的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, the dual-optical attention fusion crowd head point counting
model (TAPNet) is proposed to address the problem of the difficulty of accurate
counting in complex scenes such as crowd dense occlusion and low light in crowd
counting tasks under UAV view. The model designs a dual-optical attention
fusion module (DAFP) by introducing complementary information from infrared
images to improve the accuracy and robustness of all-day crowd counting. In
order to fully utilize different modal information and solve the problem of
inaccurate localization caused by systematic misalignment between image pairs,
this paper also proposes an adaptive two-optical feature decomposition fusion
module (AFDF). In addition, we optimize the training strategy to improve the
model robustness through spatial random offset data augmentation. Experiments
on two challenging public datasets, DroneRGBT and GAIIC2, show that the
proposed method outperforms existing techniques in terms of performance,
especially in challenging dense low-light scenes. Code is available at

TLDR: 论文提出了一种无监督学习方法UCDM，通过从无标签数据中构建正负对来训练分类器，解决了训练数据与目标任务中类别分布不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要针对半监督场景，依赖标记数据，限制了其适用性和性能。UCDM旨在通过无监督学习解决这一问题。

Method: UCDM随机采样图像，利用扩散模型添加或删除语义类别以合成多样化的训练对，并引入基于置信度的伪标签机制迭代优化训练数据。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，UCDM显著优于现有半监督方法，特别是在Tiny-ImageNet数据集上，无标签数据下性能提升显著。

Conclusion: UCDM为类别分布不匹配问题提供了一种高效的无监督解决方案，性能优于依赖标记数据的方法。

Abstract: Class distribution mismatch (CDM) refers to the discrepancy between class
distributions in training data and target tasks. Previous methods address this
by designing classifiers to categorize classes known during training, while
grouping unknown or new classes into an "other" category. However, they focus
on semi-supervised scenarios and heavily rely on labeled data, limiting their
applicability and performance. To address this, we propose Unsupervised
Learning for Class Distribution Mismatch (UCDM), which constructs
positive-negative pairs from unlabeled data for classifier training. Our
approach randomly samples images and uses a diffusion model to add or erase
semantic classes, synthesizing diverse training pairs. Additionally, we
introduce a confidence-based labeling mechanism that iteratively assigns
pseudo-labels to valuable real-world data and incorporates them into the
training process. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate UCDM's
superiority over previous semi-supervised methods. Specifically, with a 60%
mismatch proportion on Tiny-ImageNet dataset, our approach, without relying on
labeled data, surpasses OpenMatch (with 40 labels per class) by 35.1%, 63.7%,
and 72.5% in classifying known, unknown, and new classes.

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有无监督域适应方法，性能接近有监督方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用了RGB与热图像的互补信息，提升了低光照条件下的分割性能。

Abstract: In autonomous driving, thermal image semantic segmentation has emerged as a
critical research area, owing to its ability to provide robust scene
understanding under adverse visual conditions. In particular, unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) for thermal image segmentation can be an efficient
solution to address the lack of labeled thermal datasets. Nevertheless, since
these methods do not effectively utilize the complementary information between
RGB and thermal images, they significantly decrease performance during domain
adaptation. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on cross-spectral
UDA for thermal image semantic segmentation. We first propose a novel masked
mutual learning strategy that promotes complementary information exchange by
selectively transferring results between each spectral model while masking out
uncertain regions. Additionally, we introduce a novel prototypical
self-supervised loss designed to enhance the performance of the thermal
segmentation model in nighttime scenarios. This approach addresses the
limitations of RGB pre-trained networks, which cannot effectively transfer
knowledge under low illumination due to the inherent constraints of RGB
sensors. In experiments, our method achieves higher performance over previous
UDA methods and comparable performance to state-of-the-art supervised methods.

TLDR: 提出了一种无需训练的自适应掩码模块，用于加速图像超分辨率任务，通过动态聚焦计算于高频区域以减少计算量，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加速图像超分辨率任务的关键在于减少计算量而不牺牲性能和适应性，高频区域（如边缘和纹理）对重建至关重要。

Method: 通过高斯模糊减法提取高频成分，使用K-means聚类生成自适应二进制掩码，识别需要密集处理的区域。该方法可轻松集成到CNN和Transformer架构中。

Result: 在基准测试中，该方法将FLOPs减少24-43%，同时保持或提升定量指标。

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态掩码和稀疏计算显著减少计算量，适用于多种架构和未知退化情况。

Abstract: The primary challenge in accelerating image super-resolution lies in reducing
computation while maintaining performance and adaptability. Motivated by the
observation that high-frequency regions (e.g., edges and textures) are most
critical for reconstruction, we propose a training-free adaptive masking module
for acceleration that dynamically focuses computation on these challenging
areas. Specifically, our method first extracts high-frequency components via
Gaussian blur subtraction and adaptively generates binary masks using K-means
clustering to identify regions requiring intensive processing. Our method can
be easily integrated with both CNNs and Transformers. For CNN-based
architectures, we replace standard $3 \times 3$ convolutions with an unfold
operation followed by $1 \times 1$ convolutions, enabling pixel-wise sparse
computation guided by the mask. For Transformer-based models, we partition the
mask into non-overlapping windows and selectively process tokens based on their
average values. During inference, unnecessary pixels or windows are pruned,
significantly reducing computation. Moreover, our method supports
dilation-based mask adjustment to control the processing scope without
retraining, and is robust to unseen degradations (e.g., noise, compression).
Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method reduces FLOPs
by 24--43% for state-of-the-art models (e.g., CARN, SwinIR) while achieving
comparable or better quantitative metrics. The source code is available at

Method: 提出STPM模块自回归注入结构和纹理特征，并引入TTRO优化细节。

Result: 实验显示CLIP-I和DINO一致性指标分别提升7.8和13.1。

Conclusion: STPM和TTRO有效提升了CT2V生成的一致性和细节质量。

Abstract: Both zero-shot and tuning-based customized text-to-image (CT2I) generation
have made significant progress for storytelling content creation. In contrast,
research on customized text-to-video (CT2V) generation remains relatively
limited. Existing zero-shot CT2V methods suffer from poor generalization, while
another line of work directly combining tuning-based T2I models with temporal
motion modules often leads to the loss of structural and texture information.
To bridge this gap, we propose an autoregressive structure and texture
propagation module (STPM), which extracts key structural and texture features
from the reference subject and injects them autoregressively into each video
frame to enhance consistency. Additionally, we introduce a test-time reward
optimization (TTRO) method to further refine fine-grained details. Quantitative
and qualitative experiments validate the effectiveness of STPM and TTRO,
demonstrating improvements of 7.8 and 13.1 in CLIP-I and DINO consistency
metrics over the baseline, respectively.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models are hindered by high
computational demands, limiting accessibility and scalability. This paper
introduces KDC-Diff, a novel stable diffusion framework that enhances
efficiency while maintaining image quality. KDC-Diff features a streamlined
U-Net architecture with nearly half the parameters of the original U-Net
(482M), significantly reducing model complexity. We propose a dual-layered
distillation strategy to ensure high-fidelity generation, transferring semantic
and structural insights from a teacher to a compact student model while
minimizing quality degradation. Additionally, replay-based continual learning
is integrated to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, allowing the model to retain
prior knowledge while adapting to new data. Despite operating under extremely
low computational resources, KDC-Diff achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the Oxford Flowers and Butterflies & Moths 100 Species datasets, demonstrating
competitive metrics such as FID, CLIP, and LPIPS. Moreover, it significantly
reduces inference time compared to existing models. These results establish
KDC-Diff as a highly efficient and adaptable solution for text-to-image

Conclusion: 通过Gut-VLM数据集和幻觉感知微调方法，论文为医学VLMs的幻觉问题提供了有效解决方案，并建立了新的研究基准。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly popular in the
medical domain, bridging the gap between medical images and clinical language.
Existing VLMs demonstrate an impressive ability to comprehend medical images
and text queries to generate detailed, descriptive diagnostic medical reports.
However, hallucination--the tendency to generate descriptions that are
inconsistent with the visual content--remains a significant issue in VLMs, with
particularly severe implications in the medical field. To facilitate VLM
research on gastrointestinal (GI) image analysis and study hallucination, we
curate a multimodal image-text GI dataset: Gut-VLM. This dataset is created
using a two-stage pipeline: first, descriptive medical reports of Kvasir-v2
images are generated using ChatGPT, which introduces some hallucinated or
incorrect texts. In the second stage, medical experts systematically review
these reports, and identify and correct potential inaccuracies to ensure
high-quality, clinically reliable annotations. Unlike traditional datasets that
contain only descriptive texts, our dataset also features tags identifying
hallucinated sentences and their corresponding corrections. A common approach
to reducing hallucination in VLM is to finetune the model on a small-scale,
problem-specific dataset. However, we take a different strategy using our
dataset. Instead of finetuning the VLM solely for generating textual reports,
we finetune it to detect and correct hallucinations, an approach we call
hallucination-aware finetuning. Our results show that this approach is better
than simply finetuning for descriptive report generation. Additionally, we
conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs across several
metrics, establishing a benchmark. GitHub Repo:

Conclusion: CMD为3D生成提供了灵活性和高效性，支持局部编辑。

Abstract: Recently, 3D generation methods have shown their powerful ability to automate
3D model creation. However, most 3D generation methods only rely on an input
image or a text prompt to generate a 3D model, which lacks the control of each
component of the generated 3D model. Any modifications of the input image lead
to an entire regeneration of the 3D models. In this paper, we introduce a new
method called CMD that generates a 3D model from an input image while enabling
flexible local editing of each component of the 3D model. In CMD, we formulate
the 3D generation as a conditional multiview diffusion model, which takes the
existing or known parts as conditions and generates the edited or added
components. This conditional multiview diffusion model not only allows the
generation of 3D models part by part but also enables local editing of 3D
models according to the local revision of the input image without changing
other 3D parts. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that CMD
decomposes a complex 3D generation task into multiple components, improving the
generation quality. Meanwhile, CMD enables efficient and flexible local editing
of a 3D model by just editing one rendered image.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新型的Micro-Expression Large Language Model (MELLM)，结合了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的推理能力和微表情的细微动态感知策略，首次探索了MLLMs在微表情分析领域的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前微表情识别研究主要集中于离散情绪分类，缺乏对细微动态运动和内在情感线索的深入分析。多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉语言任务中的成功为微表情的全面理解提供了新可能。

Method: MELLM通过融合起始-顶点光流动态与灰度起始帧构建可解释的运动增强彩色图作为输入，并结合专门的微调策略增强模型对微表情的视觉感知。此外，基于FACS标注和情感标签构建了指令描述数据集用于训练。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的综合评估表明，MELLM在微表情理解（MEU）方面表现出卓越的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: MELLM为微表情分析领域提供了新的解决方案，展示了MLLMs在理解细微动态和情感语义方面的潜力。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are crucial psychological responses with significant
potential for affective computing. However, current automatic micro-expression
recognition (MER) research primarily focuses on discrete emotion
classification, neglecting a convincing analysis of the subtle dynamic
movements and inherent emotional cues. The rapid progress in multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), known for their strong multimodal comprehension and
language generation abilities, offers new possibilities. MLLMs have shown
success in various vision-language tasks, indicating their potential to
understand MEs comprehensively, including both fine-grained motion patterns and
underlying emotional semantics. Nevertheless, challenges remain due to the
subtle intensity and short duration of MEs, as existing MLLMs are not designed
to capture such delicate frame-level facial dynamics. In this paper, we propose
a novel Micro-Expression Large Language Model (MELLM), which incorporates a
subtle facial motion perception strategy with the strong inference capabilities
of MLLMs, representing the first exploration of MLLMs in the domain of ME
analysis. Specifically, to explicitly guide the MLLM toward motion-sensitive
regions, we construct an interpretable motion-enhanced color map by fusing
onset-apex optical flow dynamics with the corresponding grayscale onset frame
as the model input. Additionally, specialized fine-tuning strategies are
incorporated to further enhance the model's visual perception of MEs.
Furthermore, we construct an instruction-description dataset based on Facial
Action Coding System (FACS) annotations and emotion labels to train our MELLM.
Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our model exhibits superior robustness and generalization capabilities in ME
understanding (MEU). Code is available at https://github.com/zyzhangUstc/MELLM.

Conclusion: 该方法为鲁棒的多任务和多模态生理传感设定了新基准，并提供了高效的计算框架，适用于非约束环境。

Abstract: Remote physiological sensing using camera-based technologies offers
transformative potential for non-invasive vital sign monitoring across
healthcare and human-computer interaction domains. Although deep learning
approaches have advanced the extraction of physiological signals from video
data, existing methods have not been sufficiently assessed for their robustness
to domain shifts. These shifts in remote physiological sensing include
variations in ambient conditions, camera specifications, head movements, facial
poses, and physiological states which often impact real-world performance
significantly. Cross-dataset evaluation provides an objective measure to assess
generalization capabilities across these domain shifts. We introduce Target
Signal Constrained Factorization module (TSFM), a novel multidimensional
attention mechanism that explicitly incorporates physiological signal
characteristics as factorization constraints, allowing more precise feature
extraction. Building on this innovation, we present MMRPhys, an efficient
dual-branch 3D-CNN architecture designed for simultaneous multitask estimation
of photoplethysmography (rPPG) and respiratory (rRSP) signals from multimodal
RGB and thermal video inputs. Through comprehensive cross-dataset evaluation on
five benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that MMRPhys with TSFM significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generalization across domain shifts for
rPPG and rRSP estimation, while maintaining a minimal inference latency
suitable for real-time applications. Our approach establishes new benchmarks
for robust multitask and multimodal physiological sensing and offers a
computationally efficient framework for practical deployment in unconstrained
environments. The web browser-based application featuring on-device real-time
inference of MMRPhys model is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究难以整合图像和文本模态，且依赖缺乏领域特定信息的预训练数据集。

Method: SCOLD利用186,000个图像-描述对进行任务无关预训练，通过软目标平滑标签以提升泛化能力。

Result: SCOLD在零样本、少样本分类等任务中优于现有模型，参数规模保持竞争力。

Conclusion: SCOLD为农业视觉语言模型提供了坚实基础，未来可扩展至长文本、简化上下文及多模态系统。

Abstract: Leaf disease identification plays a pivotal role in smart agriculture.
However, many existing studies still struggle to integrate image and textual
modalities to compensate for each other's limitations. Furthermore, many of
these approaches rely on pretraining with constrained datasets such as
ImageNet, which lack domain-specific information. We propose SCOLD (Soft-target
COntrastive learning for Leaf Disease identification), a context-aware
vision-language foundation model tailored to address these challenges for
agricultural tasks. SCOLD is developed using a diverse corpus of plant leaf
images and corresponding symptom descriptions, comprising over 186,000
image-caption pairs aligned with 97 unique concepts. Through task-agnostic
pretraining, SCOLD leverages contextual soft targets to mitigate overconfidence
in contrastive learning by smoothing labels, thereby improving model
generalization and robustness on fine-grained classification tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that SCOLD outperforms existing
vision-language models such as OpenAI-CLIP-L, BioCLIP, and SigLIP2 across
several benchmarks, including zero-shot and few-shot classification, image-text
retrieval, and image classification, while maintaining a competitive parameter
footprint. Ablation studies further highlight SCOLD's effectiveness in contrast
to its counterparts. The proposed approach significantly advances the
agricultural vision-language foundation model, offering strong performance with
minimal or no supervised fine-tuning. This work lays a solid groundwork for
future research on models trained with long-form and simplified contexts, tasks
involving class ambiguity, and multi-modal systems for intelligent plant
disease diagnostics. The code for this study is available at

Abstract: We present MarkMatch, a retrieval system for detecting whether two paper
ballot marks were filled by the same hand. Unlike the previous SOTA method
BubbleSig, which used binary classification on isolated mark pairs, MarkMatch
ranks stylistic similarity between a query mark and a mark in the database
using contrastive learning. Our model is trained with a dense batch similarity
matrix and a dual loss objective. Each sample is contrasted against many
negatives within each batch, enabling the model to learn subtle handwriting
difference and improve generalization under handwriting variation and visual
noise, while diagonal supervision reinforces high confidence on true matches.
The model achieves an F1 score of 0.943, surpassing BubbleSig's best
performance. MarkMatch also integrates Segment Anything Model for flexible mark
extraction via box- or point-based prompts. The system offers election auditors
a practical tool for visual, non-biometric investigation of suspicious ballots.

Abstract: Fabric defect detection confronts two fundamental challenges. First,
conventional non-maximum suppression disrupts gradient flow, which hinders
genuine end-to-end learning. Second, acquiring pixel-level annotations at
industrial scale is prohibitively costly. Addressing these limitations, we
propose a differentiable NMS framework for fabric defect detection that
achieves superior localization precision through end-to-end optimization. We
reformulate NMS as a differentiable bipartite matching problem solved through
the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, maintaining uninterrupted gradient flow
throughout the network. This approach specifically targets the irregular
morphologies and ambiguous boundaries of fabric defects by integrating proposal
quality, feature similarity, and spatial relationships. Our entropy-constrained
mask refinement mechanism further enhances localization precision through
principled uncertainty modeling. Extensive experiments on the Tianchi fabric
defect dataset demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing
methods while maintaining real-time speeds suitable for industrial deployment.
The framework exhibits remarkable adaptability across different architectures
and generalizes effectively to general object detection tasks.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为DSSS的新框架，通过RGB-D跨模态风格化流和深度敏感软抑制技术，从深度图中学习域不变特征，用于DG语义分割任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的UDA方法依赖目标域数据，而DG方法虽无需目标数据，但在处理深度图时忽略了噪声和空洞问题，导致域不变特征学习不足。

Method: 提出RGB-D跨模态风格化流生成风格化深度图，设计类级软空间敏感抑制技术，并引入RGB-D软对齐损失。

Result: 实验表明，DSSS框架在多骨干网络上显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: DSSS是首个在多类DG语义分割任务中整合RGB与深度信息的工作，展现了卓越的性能提升。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to align source and target domain
distributions to close the domain gap, but still struggles with obtaining the
target data. Fortunately, Domain Generalization (DG) excels without the need
for any target data. Recent works expose that depth maps contribute to improved
generalized performance in the UDA tasks, but they ignore the noise and holes
in depth maps due to device and environmental factors, failing to sufficiently
and effectively learn domain-invariant representation. Although
high-sensitivity region suppression has shown promising results in learning
domain-invariant features, existing methods cannot be directly applicable to
depth maps due to their unique characteristics. Hence, we propose a novel
framework, namely Depth-Sensitive Soft Suppression with RGB-D inter-modal
stylization flow (DSSS), focusing on learning domain-invariant features from
depth maps for the DG semantic segmentation. Specifically, we propose the RGB-D
inter-modal stylization flow to generate stylized depth maps for sensitivity
detection, cleverly utilizing RGB information as the stylization source. Then,
a class-wise soft spatial sensitivity suppression is designed to identify and
emphasize non-sensitive depth features that contain more domain-invariant
information. Furthermore, an RGB-D soft alignment loss is proposed to ensure
that the stylized depth maps only align part of the RGB features while still
retaining the unique depth information. To our best knowledge, our DSSS
framework is the first work to integrate RGB and Depth information in the
multi-class DG semantic segmentation task. Extensive experiments over multiple
backbone networks show that our framework achieves remarkable performance
improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法分为训练依赖和无训练两类，前者计算成本高，后者性能不足，需改进。

Method: DAPE采用两阶段PEFT：第一阶段通过规范调优增强时间一致性，第二阶段引入视觉友好适配器提升质量。

Result: 实验表明DAPE在时间一致性和文本-视频对齐上优于现有方法，并在多个数据集上验证。

Conclusion: DAPE为视频编辑提供高质量且成本低的解决方案，同时新基准数据集弥补了现有评估不足。

Abstract: Video generation based on diffusion models presents a challenging multimodal
task, with video editing emerging as a pivotal direction in this field. Recent
video editing approaches primarily fall into two categories: training-required
and training-free methods. While training-based methods incur high
computational costs, training-free alternatives often yield suboptimal
performance. To address these limitations, we propose DAPE, a high-quality yet
cost-effective two-stage parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) framework for
video editing. In the first stage, we design an efficient norm-tuning method to
enhance temporal consistency in generated videos. The second stage introduces a
vision-friendly adapter to improve visual quality. Additionally, we identify
critical shortcomings in existing benchmarks, including limited category
diversity, imbalanced object distribution, and inconsistent frame counts. To
mitigate these issues, we curate a large dataset benchmark comprising 232
videos with rich annotations and 6 editing prompts, enabling objective and
comprehensive evaluation of advanced methods. Extensive experiments on existing
datasets (BalanceCC, LOVEU-TGVE, RAVE) and our proposed benchmark demonstrate
that DAPE significantly improves temporal coherence and text-video alignment
while outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches.

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上显著提升感知质量和细节恢复能力。

Conclusion: SAMSR在语义复杂图像中表现优异，代码已开源。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image super-resolution (SR) methods have demonstrated
remarkable performance. Recent advancements have introduced deterministic
sampling processes that reduce inference from 15 iterative steps to a single
step, thereby significantly improving the inference speed of existing diffusion
models. However, their efficiency remains limited when handling complex
semantic regions due to the single-step inference. To address this limitation,
we propose SAMSR, a semantic-guided diffusion framework that incorporates
semantic segmentation masks into the sampling process. Specifically, we
introduce the SAM-Noise Module, which refines Gaussian noise using segmentation
masks to preserve spatial and semantic features. Furthermore, we develop a
pixel-wise sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the residual transfer
rate and noise strength based on pixel-level semantic weights, prioritizing
semantically rich regions during the diffusion process. To enhance model
training, we also propose a semantic consistency loss, which aligns pixel-wise
semantic weights between predictions and ground truth. Extensive experiments on
both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that SAMSR significantly
improves perceptual quality and detail recovery, particularly in semantically
complex images. Our code is released at https://github.com/Liu-Zihang/SAMSR.

Abstract: Concept-based explanations have emerged as an effective approach within
Explainable Artificial Intelligence, enabling interpretable insights by
aligning model decisions with human-understandable concepts. However, existing
methods rely on computationally intensive procedures and struggle to
efficiently capture complex, semantic concepts. Recently, the Concept Discovery
through Latent Diffusion-based Counterfactual Trajectories (CDCT) framework,
introduced by Varshney et al. (2025), attempts to identify concepts via
dimension-wise traversal of the latent space of a Variational Autoencoder
trained on counterfactual trajectories. Extending the CDCT framework, this work
introduces Concept Directions via Latent Clustering (CDLC), which extracts
global, class-specific concept directions by clustering latent difference
vectors derived from factual and diffusion-generated counterfactual image
pairs. CDLC substantially reduces computational complexity by eliminating the
exhaustive latent dimension traversal required in CDCT and enables the
extraction of multidimensional semantic concepts encoded across the latent
dimensions. This approach is validated on a real-world skin lesion dataset,
demonstrating that the extracted concept directions align with clinically
recognized dermoscopic features and, in some cases, reveal dataset-specific
biases or unknown biomarkers. These results highlight that CDLC is
interpretable, scalable, and applicable across high-stakes domains and diverse
data modalities.

Abstract: Recently, numerous pancreas segmentation methods have achieved promising
performance on local single-source datasets. However, these methods don't
adequately account for generalizability issues, and hence typically show
limited performance and low stability on test data from other sources.
Considering the limited availability of distinct data sources, we seek to
improve the generalization performance of a pancreas segmentation model trained
with a single-source dataset, i.e., the single source generalization task. In
particular, we propose a dual self-supervised learning model that incorporates
both global and local anatomical contexts. Our model aims to fully exploit the
anatomical features of the intra-pancreatic and extra-pancreatic regions, and
hence enhance the characterization of the high-uncertainty regions for more
robust generalization. Specifically, we first construct a global-feature
contrastive self-supervised learning module that is guided by the pancreatic
spatial structure. This module obtains complete and consistent pancreatic
features through promoting intra-class cohesion, and also extracts more
discriminative features for differentiating between pancreatic and
non-pancreatic tissues through maximizing inter-class separation. It mitigates
the influence of surrounding tissue on the segmentation outcomes in
high-uncertainty regions. Subsequently, a local-image restoration
self-supervised learning module is introduced to further enhance the
characterization of the high uncertainty regions. In this module, informative
anatomical contexts are actually learned to recover randomly corrupted
appearance patterns in those regions.

Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are prone to producing visually ungrounded
responses when interpreting associated images. In contrast, when humans embark
on learning new knowledge, they often rely on a set of fundamental pre-study
principles: reviewing outlines to grasp core concepts, summarizing key points
to guide their focus and enhance understanding. However, such preparatory
actions are notably absent in the current instruction tuning processes. This
paper presents Re-Critic, an easily scalable rationale-augmented framework
designed to incorporate fundamental rules and chain-of-thought (CoT) as a
bridge to enhance reasoning abilities. Specifically, Re-Critic develops a
visual rationale synthesizer that scalably augments raw instructions with
rationale explanation. To probe more contextually grounded responses, Re-Critic
employs an in-context self-critic mechanism to select response pairs for
preference tuning. Experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned with our
rationale-augmented dataset yield gains that extend beyond
hallucination-specific tasks to broader multimodal reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 现有基于学习的LPR方法在训练新环境后容易遗忘旧环境的知识（灾难性遗忘），影响性能。

Result: KDF框架显著提升了LPR性能，在Recall@1和遗忘分数上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: KDF是一种有效的持续学习框架，可应用于不同网络以克服灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: Place recognition plays a significant role in SLAM, robot navigation, and
autonomous driving applications. Benefiting from deep learning, the performance
of LiDAR place recognition (LPR) has been greatly improved. However, many
existing learning-based LPR methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, which
severely harms the performance of LPR on previously trained places after
training on a new environment. In this paper, we introduce a continual learning
framework for LPR via Knowledge Distillation and Fusion (KDF) to alleviate
forgetting. Inspired by the ranking process of place recognition retrieval, we
present a ranking-aware knowledge distillation loss that encourages the network
to preserve the high-level place recognition knowledge. We also introduce a
knowledge fusion module to integrate the knowledge of old and new models for
LiDAR place recognition. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that KDF can be
applied to different networks to overcome catastrophic forgetting, surpassing
the state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean Recall@1 and forgetting score.

TLDR: DOT-CBM框架通过局部图像块与概念的细粒度对齐，解决了传统CBM的虚假视觉-概念关系和局部解释性问题，提升了模型可靠性和预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CBM仅学习图像与概念的粗粒度关系，忽略局部信息，导致虚假关系和解释性不足。

Result: DOT-CBM在图像分类、局部检测和分布外泛化等任务中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: DOT-CBM通过细粒度对齐和运输先验，显著提升了CBM的可靠性和解释性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) try to make the decision-making process
transparent by exploring an intermediate concept space between the input image
and the output prediction. Existing CBMs just learn coarse-grained relations
between the whole image and the concepts, less considering local image
information, leading to two main drawbacks: i) they often produce spurious
visual-concept relations, hence decreasing model reliability; and ii) though
CBMs could explain the importance of every concept to the final prediction, it
is still challenging to tell which visual region produces the prediction. To
solve these problems, this paper proposes a Disentangled Optimal Transport CBM
(DOT-CBM) framework to explore fine-grained visual-concept relations between
local image patches and concepts. Specifically, we model the concept prediction
process as a transportation problem between the patches and concepts, thereby
achieving explicit fine-grained feature alignment. We also incorporate
orthogonal projection losses within the modality to enhance local feature
disentanglement. To further address the shortcut issues caused by statistical
biases in the data, we utilize the visual saliency map and concept label
statistics as transportation priors. Thus, DOT-CBM can visualize inversion
heatmaps, provide more reliable concept predictions, and produce more accurate
class predictions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed
DOT-CBM achieves SOTA performance on several tasks, including image
classification, local part detection and out-of-distribution generalization.

Conclusion: LDDS方法能够在不依赖特定增强选择的情况下，有效提升检测器的泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalizing an object detector trained on a single domain to multiple unseen
domains is a challenging task. Existing methods typically introduce image or
feature augmentation to diversify the source domain to raise the robustness of
the detector. Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based augmentation techniques have
been proven to be effective, but they require that the detector's backbone has
the same structure as the image encoder of VLM, limiting the detector framework
selection. To address this problem, we propose Language-Driven Dual Style
Mixing (LDDS) for single-domain generalization, which diversifies the source
domain by fully utilizing the semantic information of the VLM. Specifically, we
first construct prompts to transfer style semantics embedded in the VLM to an
image translation network. This facilitates the generation of style diversified
images with explicit semantic information. Then, we propose image-level style
mixing between the diversified images and source domain images. This
effectively mines the semantic information for image augmentation without
relying on specific augmentation selections. Finally, we propose feature-level
style mixing in a double-pipeline manner, allowing feature augmentation to be
model-agnostic and can work seamlessly with the mainstream detector frameworks,
including the one-stage, two-stage, and transformer-based detectors. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across various
benchmark datasets, including real to cartoon and normal to adverse weather
tasks. The source code and pre-trained models will be publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中，检索数据库可能仅包含部分类别的标注样本（不完整检索数据库），导致现有方法性能受限。论文旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: 提出IJIP框架：1）迭代判断阶段将多分类问题转化为多个二分类任务；2）集成预测阶段结合图像和迭代结果提升分类精度。

Conclusion: IJIP有效解决了不完整检索数据库下的学习问题，性能优越且可扩展至提示学习和文本领域。

Abstract: Large vision language models (LVLMs) achieve remarkable performance through
Vision In-context Learning (VICL), a process that depends significantly on
demonstrations retrieved from an extensive collection of annotated examples
(retrieval database). Existing studies often assume that the retrieval database
contains annotated examples for all labels. However, in real-world scenarios,
delays in database updates or incomplete data annotation may result in the
retrieval database containing labeled samples for only a subset of classes. We
refer to this phenomenon as an \textbf{incomplete retrieval database} and
define the in-context learning under this condition as \textbf{Incomplete
In-context Learning (IICL)}. To address this challenge, we propose
\textbf{Iterative Judgments and Integrated Prediction (IJIP)}, a two-stage
framework designed to mitigate the limitations of IICL. The Iterative Judgments
Stage reformulates an \(\boldsymbol{m}\)-class classification problem into a
series of \(\boldsymbol{m}\) binary classification tasks, effectively
converting the IICL setting into a standard VICL scenario. The Integrated
Prediction Stage further refines the classification process by leveraging both
the input image and the predictions from the Iterative Judgments Stage to
enhance overall classification accuracy. IJIP demonstrates considerable
performance across two LVLMs and two datasets under three distinct conditions
of label incompleteness, achieving the highest accuracy of 93.9\%. Notably,
even in scenarios where labels are fully available, IJIP still achieves the
best performance of all six baselines. Furthermore, IJIP can be directly
applied to \textbf{Prompt Learning} and is adaptable to the \textbf{text
domain}.

Conclusion: 改进的卡尔曼滤波器显著提升跟踪精度和适应性，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: This work addresses the critical lack of precision in state estimation in the
Kalman filter for 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) and the ongoing challenge of
selecting the appropriate motion model. Existing literature commonly relies on
constant motion models for estimating the states of objects, neglecting the
complex motion dynamics unique to each object. Consequently, trajectory
division and imprecise object localization arise, especially under occlusion
conditions. The core of these challenges lies in the limitations of the current
Kalman filter formulation, which fails to account for the variability of motion
dynamics as objects navigate their environments. This work introduces a novel
formulation of the Kalman filter that incorporates motion dynamics, allowing
the motion model to adaptively adjust according to changes in the object's
movement. The proposed Kalman filter substantially improves state estimation,
localization, and trajectory prediction compared to the traditional Kalman
filter. This is reflected in tracking performance that surpasses recent
benchmarks on the KITTI and Waymo Open Datasets, with margins of 0.56\% and
0.81\% in higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA) and multi-object tracking
accuracy (MOTA), respectively. Furthermore, the proposed Kalman filter
consistently outperforms the baseline across various detectors. Additionally,
it shows an enhanced capability in managing long occlusions compared to the
baseline Kalman filter, achieving margins of 1.22\% in higher order tracking
accuracy (HOTA) and 1.55\% in multi-object tracking accuracy (MOTA) on the
KITTI dataset. The formulation's efficiency is evident, with an additional
processing time of only approximately 0.078 ms per frame, ensuring its
applicability in real-time applications.

Abstract: Visual quality inspection in automotive production is essential for ensuring
the safety and reliability of vehicles. Computer vision (CV) has become a
popular solution for these inspections due to its cost-effectiveness and
reliability. However, CV models require large, annotated datasets, which are
costly and time-consuming to collect. To reduce the need for extensive training
data, we propose a novel image classification pipeline that combines similarity
search using a vision-based foundation model with synthetic data. Our approach
leverages a DINOv2 model to transform input images into feature vectors, which
are then compared to pre-classified reference images using cosine distance
measurements. By utilizing synthetic data instead of real images as references,
our pipeline achieves high classification accuracy without relying on real
data. We evaluate this approach in eight real-world inspection scenarios and
demonstrate that it meets the high performance requirements of production
environments.

Abstract: We propose Skywork-VL Reward, a multimodal reward model that provides reward

Experimental evaluations show that Skywork-VL Reward achieves state-of-the-art
results on multimodal VL-RewardBench and exhibits competitive performance on
the text-only RewardBench benchmark. Furthermore, preference data constructed
based on our Skywork-VL Reward proves highly effective for training Mixed

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零成本代理方法主要局限于卷积架构，而随着大语言模型的兴起，需要将其扩展至Vision Transformers。此外，不同代理包含互补信息，需通过机器学习方法优化组合。

Method: 提出L-SWAG度量以通用化评估卷积和Transformer架构，并设计LIBRA-NAS方法，通过机器学习策略组合代理以优化特定任务。

Result: LIBRA-NAS在0.1 GPU天内找到ImageNet1k上测试误差17.0%的架构，优于进化和基于梯度的NAS方法。

Conclusion: 该工作成功将ZC-NAS扩展至ViTs，并通过L-SWAG和LIBRA-NAS显著提升了搜索效率和性能。

Abstract: Training-free Neural Architecture Search (NAS) efficiently identifies
high-performing neural networks using zero-cost (ZC) proxies. Unlike multi-shot
and one-shot NAS approaches, ZC-NAS is both (i) time-efficient, eliminating the
need for model training, and (ii) interpretable, with proxy designs often
theoretically grounded. Despite rapid developments in the field, current SOTA
ZC proxies are typically constrained to well-established convolutional search
spaces. With the rise of Large Language Models shaping the future of deep
learning, this work extends ZC proxy applicability to Vision Transformers
(ViTs). We present a new benchmark using the Autoformer search space evaluated
on 6 distinct tasks and propose Layer-Sample Wise Activation with Gradients
information (L-SWAG), a novel, generalizable metric that characterizes both
convolutional and transformer architectures across 14 tasks. Additionally,
previous works highlighted how different proxies contain complementary
information, motivating the need for a ML model to identify useful
combinations. To further enhance ZC-NAS, we therefore introduce LIBRA-NAS (Low
Information gain and Bias Re-Alignment), a method that strategically combines
proxies to best represent a specific benchmark. Integrated into the NAS search,
LIBRA-NAS outperforms evolution and gradient-based NAS techniques by
identifying an architecture with a 17.0% test error on ImageNet1k in just 0.1
GPU days.

Abstract: In 3D Human Motion Prediction (HMP), conventional methods train HMP models
with expensive motion capture data. However, the data collection cost of such
motion capture data limits the data diversity, which leads to poor
generalizability to unseen motions or subjects. To address this issue, this
paper proposes to enhance HMP with additional learning using estimated poses
from easily available videos. The 2D poses estimated from the monocular videos
are carefully transformed into motion capture-style 3D motions through our
pipeline. By additional learning with the obtained motions, the HMP model is
adapted to the test domain. The experimental results demonstrate the
quantitative and qualitative impact of our method.

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are a leading cause of injury and
productivity loss in the manufacturing industry, incurring substantial economic
costs. Ergonomic assessments can mitigate these risks by identifying workplace
adjustments that improve posture and reduce strain. Camera-based systems offer
a non-intrusive, cost-effective method for continuous ergonomic tracking, but
they also raise significant privacy concerns. To address this, we propose a
privacy-aware ergonomic assessment framework utilizing machine learning
techniques. Our approach employs adversarial training to develop a lightweight
neural network that obfuscates video data, preserving only the essential
information needed for human pose estimation. This obfuscation ensures
compatibility with standard pose estimation algorithms, maintaining high
accuracy while protecting privacy. The obfuscated video data is transmitted to
a central server, where state-of-the-art keypoint detection algorithms extract
body landmarks. Using multi-view integration, 3D keypoints are reconstructed
and evaluated with the Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) method. Our system
provides a secure, effective solution for ergonomic monitoring in industrial
environments, addressing both privacy and workplace safety concerns.

Method: 提出RealRep方法，解耦亮度和色度，学习多视角风格表示；引入DDACMNet框架，通过控制感知归一化机制实现自适应分层映射。

Result: 实验表明，RealRep在泛化性和HDR色域重建效果上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RealRep通过解耦表示和自适应映射，有效解决了SDR-to-HDR转换中的风格多样性问题。

Abstract: High-Dynamic-Range Wide-Color-Gamut (HDR-WCG) technology is becoming
increasingly prevalent, intensifying the demand for converting Standard Dynamic
Range (SDR) content to HDR. Existing methods primarily rely on fixed tone
mapping operators, which are inadequate for handling SDR inputs with diverse
styles commonly found in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we
propose a generalized SDR-to-HDR method that handles diverse styles in
real-world SDR content, termed Realistic Style Disentangled Representation
Learning (RealRep). By disentangling luminance and chrominance, we analyze the
intrinsic differences between contents with varying styles and propose a
disentangled multi-view style representation learning method. This approach
captures the guidance prior of true luminance and chrominance distributions
across different styles, even when the SDR style distributions exhibit
significant variations, thereby establishing a robust embedding space for
inverse tone mapping. Motivated by the difficulty of directly utilizing
degradation representation priors, we further introduce the Degradation-Domain
Aware Controlled Mapping Network (DDACMNet), a two-stage framework that
performs adaptive hierarchical mapping guided by a control-aware normalization
mechanism. DDACMNet dynamically modulates the mapping process via
degradation-conditioned hierarchical features, enabling robust adaptation
across diverse degradation domains. Extensive experiments show that RealRep
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods with superior generalization
and perceptually faithful HDR color gamut reconstruction.

Abstract: Fast 3D clothed human reconstruction from monocular video remains a
significant challenge in computer vision, particularly in balancing
computational efficiency with reconstruction quality. Current approaches are
either focused on static image reconstruction but too computationally
intensive, or achieve high quality through per-video optimization that requires
minutes to hours of processing, making them unsuitable for real-time
applications. To this end, we present TemPoFast3D, a novel method that
leverages temporal coherency of human appearance to reduce redundant
computation while maintaining reconstruction quality. Our approach is a
"plug-and play" solution that uniquely transforms pixel-aligned reconstruction
networks to handle continuous video streams by maintaining and refining a
canonical appearance representation through efficient coordinate mapping.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that TemPoFast3D matches or exceeds
state-of-the-art methods across standard metrics while providing high-quality
textured reconstruction across diverse pose and appearance, with a maximum
speed of 12 FPS.

Abstract: Background subtraction (BGS) is utilized to detect moving objects in a video
and is commonly employed at the onset of object tracking and human recognition
processes. Nevertheless, existing BGS techniques utilizing deep learning still
encounter challenges with various background noises in videos, including
variations in lighting, shifts in camera angles, and disturbances like air
turbulence or swaying trees. To address this problem, we design a spiking
autoencoder network, termed SAEN-BGS, based on noise resilience and
time-sequence sensitivity of spiking neural networks (SNNs) to enhance the
separation of foreground and background. To eliminate unnecessary background
noise and preserve the important foreground elements, we begin by creating the
continuous spiking conv-and-dconv block, which serves as the fundamental
building block for the decoder in SAEN-BGS. Moreover, in striving for enhanced

to other baseline methods, even when challenged by complex scenarios with

Abstract: In this work, we present GPDiT, a Generative Pre-trained Autoregressive
Diffusion Transformer that unifies the strengths of diffusion and
autoregressive modeling for long-range video synthesis, within a continuous
latent space. Instead of predicting discrete tokens, GPDiT autoregressively
predicts future latent frames using a diffusion loss, enabling natural modeling
of motion dynamics and semantic consistency across frames. This continuous
autoregressive framework not only enhances generation quality but also endows
the model with representation capabilities. Additionally, we introduce a
lightweight causal attention variant and a parameter-free rotation-based
time-conditioning mechanism, improving both the training and inference
efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPDiT achieves strong
performance in video generation quality, video representation ability, and

<details>

Motivation: 传统方法如右心导管术（RHC）虽精确但侵入性强，不适合常规使用，亟需非侵入性且准确的替代方案。

Method: MePH利用多视角、多模态超声心动图数据（视频、频谱图像）与RHC数据关联建模，基于1,237例患者数据训练。

Result: MePH在评估平均肺动脉压（mPAP）和肺血管阻力（PVR）时误差分别降低49.73%和43.81%，AUC达0.921，优于超声心动图医师。

Conclusion: MePH为非侵入性监测肺动脉高压提供了高效工具，支持早期干预和个性化治疗决策。

Abstract: Echocardiographers can detect pulmonary hypertension using Doppler
echocardiography; however, accurately assessing its progression often proves
challenging. Right heart catheterization (RHC), the gold standard for precise
evaluation, is invasive and unsuitable for routine use, limiting its
practicality for timely diagnosis and monitoring of pulmonary hypertension
progression. Here, we propose MePH, a multi-view, multi-modal vision-language
model to accurately assess pulmonary hypertension progression using
non-invasive echocardiography. We constructed a large dataset comprising paired
standardized echocardiogram videos, spectral images and RHC data, covering
1,237 patient cases from 12 medical centers. For the first time, MePH precisely
models the correlation between non-invasive multi-view, multi-modal
echocardiography and the pressure and resistance obtained via RHC. We show that
MePH significantly outperforms echocardiographers' assessments using
echocardiography, reducing the mean absolute error in estimating mean pulmonary
arterial pressure (mPAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) by 49.73% and
43.81%, respectively. In eight independent external hospitals, MePH achieved a
mean absolute error of 3.147 for PVR assessment. Furthermore, MePH achieved an
area under the curve of 0.921, surpassing echocardiographers (area under the
curve of 0.842) in accurately predicting the severity of pulmonary
hypertension, whether mild or severe. A prospective study demonstrated that
MePH can predict treatment efficacy for patients. Our work provides pulmonary
hypertension patients with a non-invasive and timely method for monitoring
disease progression, improving the accuracy and efficiency of pulmonary
hypertension management while enabling earlier interventions and more
personalized treatment decisions.

Motivation: 现有方法在光照一致的环境中表现良好，但在非受控环境下（如瞬态遮挡或外观变化）重建效果不佳。

Method: 通过引入稀疏3D点（来自SfM）和法线先验（结合边缘滤波和多视角一致性约束），优化隐式表面重建。

Result: 在Heritage-Recon等数据集上验证，重建精度和细节优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于文化遗产保护等多种场景，实现了高质量的非受控环境3D重建。

Abstract: Neural implicit surface reconstruction using volume rendering techniques has
recently achieved significant advancements in creating high-fidelity surfaces
from multiple 2D images. However, current methods primarily target scenes with
consistent illumination and struggle to accurately reconstruct 3D geometry in
uncontrolled environments with transient occlusions or varying appearances.
While some neural radiance field (NeRF)-based variants can better manage
photometric variations and transient objects in complex scenes, they are
designed for novel view synthesis rather than precise surface reconstruction
due to limited surface constraints. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
novel approach that applies multiple geometric constraints to the implicit
surface optimization process, enabling more accurate reconstructions from
unconstrained image collections. First, we utilize sparse 3D points from
structure-from-motion (SfM) to refine the signed distance function estimation
for the reconstructed surface, with a displacement compensation to accommodate
noise in the sparse points. Additionally, we employ robust normal priors
derived from a normal predictor, enhanced by edge prior filtering and
multi-view consistency constraints, to improve alignment with the actual
surface geometry. Extensive testing on the Heritage-Recon benchmark and other
datasets has shown that the proposed method can accurately reconstruct surfaces
from in-the-wild images, yielding geometries with superior accuracy and
granularity compared to existing techniques. Our approach enables high-quality
3D reconstruction of various landmarks, making it applicable to diverse
scenarios such as digital preservation of cultural heritage sites.

Motivation: 单类无监督方法因计算和存储成本高而受限，多类方法因特征混淆问题性能受限，需开发新方法。

Method: GLFM分三阶段：异常合成、全局-局部记忆库建立、基于特征距离的异常检测。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GLFM有效解决了多类点云异常检测中的特征混淆问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Point cloud anomaly detection is essential for various industrial
applications. The huge computation and storage costs caused by the increasing
product classes limit the application of single-class unsupervised methods,
necessitating the development of multi-class unsupervised methods. However, the
feature similarity between normal and anomalous points from different class
data leads to the feature confusion problem, which greatly hinders the
performance of multi-class methods. Therefore, we introduce a multi-class point
cloud anomaly detection method, named GLFM, leveraging global-local feature
matching to progressively separate data that are prone to confusion across
multiple classes. Specifically, GLFM is structured into three stages: Stage-I
proposes an anomaly synthesis pipeline that stretches point clouds to create
abundant anomaly data that are utilized to adapt the point cloud feature
extractor for better feature representation. Stage-II establishes the global
and local memory banks according to the global and local feature distributions
of all the training data, weakening the impact of feature confusion on the
establishment of the memory bank. Stage-III implements anomaly detection of
test data leveraging its feature distance from global and local memory banks.
Extensive experiments on the MVTec 3D-AD, Real3D-AD and actual industry parts
dataset showcase our proposed GLFM's superior point cloud anomaly detection
performance. The code is available at

Abstract: With the continuous increase in the number and resolution of video
surveillance cameras, the burden of transmitting and storing surveillance video
is growing. Traditional communication methods based on Shannon's theory are
facing optimization bottlenecks. Semantic communication, as an emerging
communication method, is expected to break through this bottleneck and reduce
the storage and transmission consumption of video. Existing semantic decoding
methods often require many samples to train the neural network for each scene,
which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study, a semantic encoding
and decoding method for surveillance video is proposed. First, the sketch was
extracted as semantic information, and a sketch compression method was proposed
to reduce the bit rate of semantic information. Then, an image translation
network was proposed to translate the sketch into a video frame with a
reference frame. Finally, a few-shot sketch decoding network was proposed to
reconstruct video from sketch. Experimental results showed that the proposed
method achieved significantly better video reconstruction performance than
baseline methods. The sketch compression method could effectively reduce the
storage and transmission consumption of semantic information with little
compromise on video quality. The proposed method provides a novel semantic
encoding and decoding method that only needs a few training samples for each
surveillance scene, thus improving the practicality of the semantic
communication system.

Abstract: Understanding the computations of convolutional neural networks requires
effective visualization of their kernels. While maximal activation methods have
proven successful in highlighting the preferred features of 2D convolutional
kernels, directly applying these techniques to 3D convolutions often leads to
uninterpretable results due to the higher dimensionality and complexity of 3D
features. To address this challenge, we propose a novel visualization approach
for 3D convolutional kernels that disentangles their texture and motion
preferences. Our method begins with a data-driven decomposition of the optimal
input that maximally activates a given kernel. We then introduce a two-stage
optimization strategy to extract distinct texture and motion components from
this input. Applying our approach to visualize kernels at various depths of
several pre-trained models, we find that the resulting
visualizations--particularly those capturing motion--clearly reveal the
preferred dynamic patterns encoded by 3D kernels. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in providing interpretable insights into 3D
convolutional operations. Code is available at

Abstract: Urban Digital Twins (UDTs) have become essential for managing cities and
integrating complex, heterogeneous data from diverse sources. Creating UDTs
involves challenges at multiple process stages, including acquiring accurate 3D
source data, reconstructing high-fidelity 3D models, maintaining models'
updates, and ensuring seamless interoperability to downstream tasks. Current
datasets are usually limited to one part of the processing chain, hampering
comprehensive UDTs validation. To address these challenges, we introduce the
first comprehensive multimodal Urban Digital Twin benchmark dataset: TUM2TWIN.
This dataset includes georeferenced, semantically aligned 3D models and
networks along with various terrestrial, mobile, aerial, and satellite
observations boasting 32 data subsets over roughly 100,000 $m^2$ and currently
767 GB of data. By ensuring georeferenced indoor-outdoor acquisition, high
accuracy, and multimodal data integration, the benchmark supports robust
analysis of sensors and the development of advanced reconstruction methods.
Additionally, we explore downstream tasks demonstrating the potential of
TUM2TWIN, including novel view synthesis of NeRF and Gaussian Splatting, solar

Method: 提出DepthFusion策略，包括全局（Depth-GFusion）和局部（Depth-LFusion）模块，分别通过深度编码调整BEV特征和原始体素特征的权重。

Result: 在nuScenes和KITTI数据集上超越现有方法，且在nuScenes-C数据集上表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DepthFusion通过深度感知特征融合显著提升了3D目标检测性能，并增强了模型对噪声的鲁棒性。

Abstract: State-of-the-art LiDAR-camera 3D object detectors usually focus on feature
fusion. However, they neglect the factor of depth while designing the fusion
strategy. In this work, we are the first to observe that different modalities
play different roles as depth varies via statistical analysis and
visualization. Based on this finding, we propose a Depth-Aware Hybrid Feature
Fusion (DepthFusion) strategy that guides the weights of point cloud and RGB
image modalities by introducing depth encoding at both global and local levels.
Specifically, the Depth-GFusion module adaptively adjusts the weights of image
Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features in multi-modal global features via depth
encoding. Furthermore, to compensate for the information lost when transferring
raw features to the BEV space, we propose a Depth-LFusion module, which
adaptively adjusts the weights of original voxel features and multi-view image
features in multi-modal local features via depth encoding. Extensive
experiments on the nuScenes and KITTI datasets demonstrate that our DepthFusion
method surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, our DepthFusion
is more robust to various kinds of corruptions, outperforming previous methods
on the nuScenes-C dataset.

Conclusion: 提出的归一化方法有效解决了潜在空间插值的退化问题，并在非退化情况下也提升了图像质量。

Abstract: There is an increasing interest in using image-generating diffusion models
for deep data augmentation and image morphing. In this context, it is useful to
interpolate between latents produced by inverting a set of input images, in
order to generate new images representing some mixture of the inputs. We
observe that such interpolation can easily lead to degenerate results when the
number of inputs is large. We analyze the cause of this effect theoretically
and experimentally, and suggest a suitable remedy. The suggested approach is a
relatively simple normalization scheme that is easy to use whenever
interpolation between latents is needed. We measure image quality using FID and
CLIP embedding distance and show experimentally that baseline interpolation
methods lead to a drop in quality metrics long before the degeneration issue is
clearly visible. In contrast, our method significantly reduces the degeneration
effect and leads to improved quality metrics also in non-degenerate situations.

Method: 提出PEAP-LLM模型，包含LLM目标规划器（LGP）和LoRA动作规划器（LAP），并采用两阶段微调（SFT和DPO）优化生成指令。

Result: 实验结果表明，PEAP-LLM在REVERIE任务上优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: PEAP-LLM通过高效规划和微调方法，显著提升了具身代理在复杂环境中的导航和定位能力。

Abstract: The remote embodied referring expression (REVERIE) task requires an agent to
navigate through complex indoor environments and localize a remote object
specified by high-level instructions, such as "bring me a spoon", without
pre-exploration. Hence, an efficient navigation plan is essential for the final
success. This paper proposes a novel parameter-efficient action planner using
large language models (PEAP-LLM) to generate a single-step instruction at each
location. The proposed model consists of two modules, LLM goal planner (LGP)
and LoRA action planner (LAP). Initially, LGP extracts the goal-oriented plan
from REVERIE instructions, including the target object and room. Then, LAP
generates a single-step instruction with the goal-oriented plan, high-level
instruction, and current visual observation as input. PEAP-LLM enables the
embodied agent to interact with LAP as the path planner on the fly. A simple
direct application of LLMs hardly achieves good performance. Also, existing
hard-prompt-based methods are error-prone in complicated scenarios and need
human intervention. To address these issues and prevent the LLM from generating
hallucinations and biased information, we propose a novel two-stage method for
fine-tuning the LLM, consisting of supervised fine-tuning (STF) and direct
preference optimization (DPO). SFT improves the quality of generated
instructions, while DPO utilizes environmental feedback. Experimental results
show the superiority of our proposed model on REVERIE compared to the previous
state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Monitoring and analyzing electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, even under varying
physiological conditions, including those influenced by physical activity,
drugs and stress, is crucial to accurately assess cardiac health. However,
current AI-based methods often fail to account for how these factors interact
and alter ECG patterns, ultimately limiting their applicability in real-world
settings. This study introduces IKrNet, a novel neural network model, which
identifies drug-specific patterns in ECGs amidst certain physiological
conditions. IKrNet's architecture incorporates spatial and temporal dynamics by
using a convolutional backbone with varying receptive field size to capture
spatial features. A bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory module is also
employed to model temporal dependencies. By treating heart rate variability as
a surrogate for physiological fluctuations, we evaluated IKrNet's performance
across diverse scenarios, including conditions with physical stress, drug
intake alone, and a baseline without drug presence. Our assessment follows a
clinical protocol in which 990 healthy volunteers were administered 80mg of
Sotalol, a drug which is known to be a precursor to Torsades-de-Pointes, a
life-threatening arrhythmia. We show that IKrNet outperforms state-of-the-art
models' accuracy and stability in varying physiological conditions,

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新型离散视觉标记器Selftok，通过自回归先验统一扩散模型和自回归架构，支持强化学习，并在视觉生成任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统空间先验在图像表示中存在局限性，Selftok旨在通过自回归先验解决这一问题，并支持视觉生成中的强化学习。

Method: Selftok利用反向扩散过程构建自回归先验，统一扩散模型和自回归架构，无需额外模块即可训练视觉语言模型。

Result: Selftok在视觉生成任务中表现优异，无需文本-图像训练对即可显著提升生成效果，超越现有模型。

Conclusion: Selftok解决了视觉标记器无法有效支持强化学习的长期挑战，为多模态大语言模型的发展迈出重要一步。

Abstract: We completely discard the conventional spatial prior in image representation
and introduce a novel discrete visual tokenizer: Self-consistency Tokenizer
(Selftok). At its design core, we compose an autoregressive (AR) prior --
mirroring the causal structure of language -- into visual tokens by using the
reverse diffusion process of image generation. The AR property makes Selftok
fundamentally distinct from traditional spatial tokens in the following two key
ways: - Selftok offers an elegant and minimalist approach to unify diffusion
and AR for vision-language models (VLMs): By representing images with Selftok
tokens, we can train a VLM using a purely discrete autoregressive architecture
-- like that in LLMs -- without requiring additional modules or training
objectives. - We theoretically show that the AR prior satisfies the Bellman
equation, whereas the spatial prior does not. Therefore, Selftok supports
reinforcement learning (RL) for visual generation with effectiveness comparable
to that achieved in LLMs. Besides the AR property, Selftok is also a SoTA
tokenizer that achieves a favorable trade-off between high-quality
reconstruction and compression rate. We use Selftok to build a pure AR VLM for
both visual comprehension and generation tasks. Impressively, without using any
text-image training pairs, a simple policy gradient RL working in the visual
tokens can significantly boost the visual generation benchmark, surpassing all
the existing models by a large margin. Therefore, we believe that Selftok
effectively addresses the long-standing challenge that visual tokens cannot
support effective RL. When combined with the well-established strengths of RL
in LLMs, this brings us one step closer to realizing a truly multimodal LLM.

TLDR: GIFStream是一种新型的4D高斯表示方法，通过规范空间和变形场增强时间特征流，解决了沉浸式视频在高质量与可控存储之间的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 沉浸式视频需要高效的渲染和存储解决方案，4D高斯喷射虽有效但难以平衡质量与存储。

Method: 引入GIFStream，结合规范空间、变形场和时间特征流，利用时间对应性和运动感知剪枝进行高效压缩，并集成时空压缩网络。

Result: 实验显示GIFStream能以30Mbps提供高质量沉浸式视频，并在RTX 4090上实现实时渲染和快速解码。

Conclusion: GIFStream在沉浸式视频领域实现了高效压缩与高质量渲染的平衡。

Abstract: Immersive video offers a 6-Dof-free viewing experience, potentially playing a
key role in future video technology. Recently, 4D Gaussian Splatting has gained
attention as an effective approach for immersive video due to its high
rendering efficiency and quality, though maintaining quality with manageable
storage remains challenging. To address this, we introduce GIFStream, a novel
4D Gaussian representation using a canonical space and a deformation field
enhanced with time-dependent feature streams. These feature streams enable
complex motion modeling and allow efficient compression by leveraging temporal
correspondence and motion-aware pruning. Additionally, we incorporate both
temporal and spatial compression networks for end-to-end compression.
Experimental results show that GIFStream delivers high-quality immersive video
at 30 Mbps, with real-time rendering and fast decoding on an RTX 4090. Project

TLDR: 提出了一种结合合成数据和公开信息的混合方法，用于生成护照数据集，以解决因隐私问题导致的真实ID文档数据不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 远程验证系统中对演示攻击检测（PAD）的需求增加，但真实ID文档数据有限，难以训练有效的PAD模型。

Method: 采用混合方法，结合合成数据和公开信息，生成符合ICAO要求的护照数据集。

Result: 生成了可用于训练和测试的真实感护照图像数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决PAD训练数据不足问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The demand for Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) to identify fraudulent ID
documents in remote verification systems has significantly risen in recent
years. This increase is driven by several factors, including the rise of remote
work, online purchasing, migration, and advancements in synthetic images.
Additionally, we have noticed a surge in the number of attacks aimed at the
enrolment process. Training a PAD to detect fake ID documents is very
challenging because of the limited number of ID documents available due to
privacy concerns. This work proposes a new passport dataset generated from a
hybrid method that combines synthetic data and open-access information using
the ICAO requirement to obtain realistic training and testing images.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种自动化处理流程，结合移动眼动仪和面部识别技术，以最小人工标注数据识别教师在课堂上关注的学生。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教师在课堂上的视觉注意力分布对学生参与度和成绩有重要影响，但传统方法需要大量人工标注，限制了研究效率。

Method: 利用先进的面部检测和识别模型，结合移动眼动仪数据，通过迁移学习训练适用于课堂场景的面部识别模型。

Result: 在四种不同教室布局中测试，结果显示U型和小型教室表现最佳，准确率分别约为0.7和0.9。

Conclusion: 该方法无需大量人工标注且非侵入性，有望提升教学策略、课堂管理和教师专业发展反馈。

Abstract: Teachers' visual attention and its distribution across the students in
classrooms can constitute important implications for student engagement,
achievement, and professional teacher training. Despite that, inferring the
information about where and which student teachers focus on is not trivial.
Mobile eye tracking can provide vital help to solve this issue; however, the
use of mobile eye tracking alone requires a significant amount of manual
annotations. To address this limitation, we present an automated processing
pipeline concept that requires minimal manually annotated data to recognize
which student the teachers focus on. To this end, we utilize state-of-the-art
face detection models and face recognition feature embeddings to train face
recognition models with transfer learning in the classroom context and combine
these models with the teachers' gaze from mobile eye trackers. We evaluated our
approach with data collected from four different classrooms, and our results
show that while it is possible to estimate the visually focused students with
reasonable performance in all of our classroom setups, U-shaped and small
classrooms led to the best results with accuracies of approximately 0.7 and
0.9, respectively. While we did not evaluate our method for teacher-student
interactions and focused on the validity of the technical approach, as our
methodology does not require a vast amount of manually annotated data and
offers a non-intrusive way of handling teachers' visual attention, it could
help improve instructional strategies, enhance classroom management, and
provide feedback for professional teacher development.

Motivation: 事件相机具有高时间分辨率、低功耗等优势，但稀疏异步事件流的处理仍具挑战性。现有方法要么牺牲性能，要么损失时间保真度。

Method: 采用GRU网络自监督训练，实现像素级事件时间戳和极性的高保真编码，支持异步推理。

Result: SSER在Gen1和1 Mpx数据集上分别提升2.4% mAP和0.6%，硬件实现达到亚微秒延迟和1-2 W功耗。

Conclusion: SSER方法在性能和效率上均优于现有基线，适用于实时低功耗应用。

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages over traditional frame-based
sensors. These include microsecond temporal resolution, robustness under
varying lighting conditions and low power consumption. Nevertheless, the
effective processing of their sparse, asynchronous event streams remains
challenging. Existing approaches to this problem can be categorised into two
distinct groups. The first group involves the direct processing of event data
with neural models, such as Spiking Neural Networks or Graph Convolutional
Neural Networks. However, this approach is often accompanied by a compromise in
terms of qualitative performance. The second group involves the conversion of
events into dense representations with handcrafted aggregation functions, which
can boost accuracy at the cost of temporal fidelity. This paper introduces a
novel Self-Supervised Event Representation (SSER) method leveraging Gated
Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks to achieve precise per-pixel encoding of event
timestamps and polarities without temporal discretisation. The recurrent layers
are trained in a self-supervised manner to maximise the fidelity of event-time
encoding. The inference is performed with event representations generated
asynchronously, thus ensuring compatibility with high-throughput sensors. The
experimental validation demonstrates that SSER outperforms aggregation-based
baselines, achieving improvements of 2.4% mAP and 0.6% on the Gen1 and 1 Mpx
object detection datasets. Furthermore, the paper presents the first hardware
implementation of recurrent representation for event data on a System-on-Chip
FPGA, achieving sub-microsecond latency and power consumption between 1-2 W,
suitable for real-time, power-efficient applications. Code is available at

Abstract: Kidney abnormality segmentation has important potential to enhance the
clinical workflow, especially in settings requiring quantitative assessments.
Kidney volume could serve as an important biomarker for renal diseases, with
changes in volume correlating directly with kidney function. Currently,
clinical practice often relies on subjective visual assessment for evaluating
kidney size and abnormalities, including tumors and cysts, which are typically
staged based on diameter, volume, and anatomical location. To support a more
objective and reproducible approach, this research aims to develop a robust,
thoroughly validated kidney abnormality segmentation algorithm, made publicly
available for clinical and research use. We employ publicly available training
datasets and leverage the state-of-the-art medical image segmentation framework
nnU-Net. Validation is conducted using both proprietary and public test
datasets, with segmentation performance quantified by Dice coefficient and the
95th percentile Hausdorff distance. Furthermore, we analyze robustness across
subgroups based on patient sex, age, CT contrast phases, and tumor histologic
subtypes. Our findings demonstrate that our segmentation algorithm, trained
exclusively on publicly available data, generalizes effectively to external
test sets and outperforms existing state-of-the-art models across all tested
datasets. Subgroup analyses reveal consistent high performance, indicating
strong robustness and reliability. The developed algorithm and associated code

as a promising approach in the era of deep learning.This paper reviews 147
recent studies,focusing on the application of supervised,unsupervised,and

constraints remain prevalent. This review highlights opportunities for future
research,including the integration of multimodal data fusion, self-supervised

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统CNN在神经响应预测中表示能力不足的问题，同时避免增加网络深度，以更接近生物视觉系统的浅层处理层次。

Method: 扩展传统3D CNN，在卷积操作中嵌入高阶操作，直接建模空间和时间上相邻像素的乘法交互。

Result: 在两种数据集上表现优异，训练数据需求减半，与神经响应的相关性高达0.75，且能自然编码几何变换（如缩放参数）。

Conclusion: 高阶CNN（HoCNN）在神经响应预测中表现卓越，尤其适用于特定细胞类型，为生物视觉系统建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to neural response prediction that incorporates
higher-order operations directly within convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Our model extends traditional 3D CNNs by embedding higher-order operations
within the convolutional operator itself, enabling direct modeling of
multiplicative interactions between neighboring pixels across space and time.
Our model increases the representational power of CNNs without increasing their
depth, therefore addressing the architectural disparity between deep artificial
networks and the relatively shallow processing hierarchy of biological visual
systems. We evaluate our approach on two distinct datasets: salamander retinal
ganglion cell (RGC) responses to natural scenes, and a new dataset of mouse RGC
responses to controlled geometric transformations. Our higher-order CNN (HoCNN)
achieves superior performance while requiring only half the training data
compared to standard architectures, demonstrating correlation coefficients up
to 0.75 with neural responses (against 0.80$\pm$0.02 retinal reliability). When
integrated into state-of-the-art architectures, our approach consistently
improves performance across different species and stimulus conditions. Analysis
of the learned representations reveals that our network naturally encodes
fundamental geometric transformations, particularly scaling parameters that
characterize object expansion and contraction. This capability is especially
relevant for specific cell types, such as transient OFF-alpha and transient ON
cells, which are known to detect looming objects and object motion
respectively, and where our model shows marked improvement in response
prediction. The correlation coefficients for scaling parameters are more than
twice as high in HoCNN (0.72) compared to baseline models (0.32).

Motivation: 现有方法通常为检索和度量定位任务设计独立模型，导致协作效率低和训练开销大。

Method: 采用统一学习策略和共享参数联合学习多粒度表示，并设计重排序机制和专用损失函数。

Result: 在VIGOR基准测试中，1米级定位召回率从1.53%提升至39.64%（同区域）和0.43%提升至25.58%（跨区域）。

Conclusion: UnifyGeo在任务独立和关联设置中均显著优于现有方法，验证了其高效性和性能优势。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization is a promising solution for large-scale
localization problems, requiring the sequential execution of retrieval and
metric localization tasks to achieve fine-grained predictions. However,
existing methods typically focus on designing standalone models for these two
tasks, resulting in inefficient collaboration and increased training overhead.
In this paper, we propose UnifyGeo, a novel unified hierarchical
geo-localization framework that integrates retrieval and metric localization
tasks into a single network. Specifically, we first employ a unified learning
strategy with shared parameters to jointly learn multi-granularity
representation, facilitating mutual reinforcement between these two tasks.
Subsequently, we design a re-ranking mechanism guided by a dedicated loss
function, which enhances geo-localization performance by improving both
retrieval accuracy and metric localization references. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that UnifyGeo significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts in
both task-isolated and task-associated settings. Remarkably, on the challenging
VIGOR benchmark, which supports fine-grained localization evaluation, the
1-meter-level localization recall rate improves from 1.53\% to 39.64\% and from
0.43\% to 25.58\% under same-area and cross-area evaluations, respectively.
Code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了多镜头视频生成的挑战，并提供了用户对镜头数量、时长和内容的控制。

Abstract: Current diffusion-based text-to-video methods are limited to producing short
video clips of a single shot and lack the capability to generate multi-shot
videos with discrete transitions where the same character performs distinct
activities across the same or different backgrounds. To address this limitation
we propose a framework that includes a dataset collection pipeline and
architectural extensions to video diffusion models to enable text-to-multi-shot
video generation. Our approach enables generation of multi-shot videos as a
single video with full attention across all frames of all shots, ensuring
character and background consistency, and allows users to control the number,
duration, and content of shots through shot-specific conditioning. This is
achieved by incorporating a transition token into the text-to-video model to
control at which frames a new shot begins and a local attention masking
strategy which controls the transition token's effect and allows shot-specific
prompting. To obtain training data we propose a novel data collection pipeline
to construct a multi-shot video dataset from existing single-shot video
datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning a pre-trained
text-to-video model for a few thousand iterations is enough for the model to
subsequently be able to generate multi-shot videos with shot-specific control,
outperforming the baselines. You can find more details in

Abstract: Automated Radiology report generation (RRG) aims at producing detailed
descriptions of medical images, reducing radiologists' workload and improving
access to high-quality diagnostic services. Existing encoder-decoder models
only rely on visual features extracted from raw input images, which can limit
the understanding of spatial structures and semantic relationships, often
resulting in suboptimal text generation. To address this, we propose Anatomical
Attention Alignment Network (A3Net), a framework that enhance visual-textual
understanding by constructing hyper-visual representations. Our approach
integrates a knowledge dictionary of anatomical structures with patch-level
visual features, enabling the model to effectively associate image regions with
their corresponding anatomical entities. This structured representation
improves semantic reasoning, interpretability, and cross-modal alignment,
ultimately enhancing the accuracy and clinical relevance of generated reports.
Experimental results on IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets demonstrate that A3Net
significantly improves both visual perception and text generation quality. Our

Motivation: 现有方法仅能防止模型零样本能力退化，但无法进一步提升其泛化能力。

Method: AFA框架包含两个模块：对抗前向遗忘适配器（学习任务不变信息）和对抗后向遗忘适配器（增强少样本学习能力）。

Result: 实验表明AFA在少样本MTIL任务中显著优于现有方法，并超越了CLIP的固有零样本性能。

Conclusion: AFA框架有效提升了VLM在增量学习中的性能，尤其在少样本任务中表现突出。

Abstract: This study aims to address the problem of multi-domain task incremental
learning~(MTIL), which requires that vision-language models~(VLMs) continuously
acquire new knowledge while maintaining their inherent zero-shot recognition
capability. Existing paradigms delegate the testing of unseen-domain samples to
the original CLIP, which only prevents the degradation of the model's zero-shot
capability but fails to enhance the generalization of the VLM further. To this
end, we propose a novel MTIL framework, named AFA, which comprises two core
modules: (1) an against forward-forgetting adapter that learns task-invariant
information for each dataset in the incremental tasks to enhance the zero-shot
recognition ability of VLMs; (2) an against backward-forgetting adapter that
strengthens the few-shot learning capability of VLMs while supporting
incremental learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the AFA method
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, especially in
few-shot MTIL tasks, and surpasses the inherent zero-shot performance of CLIP
in terms of transferability. The code is provided in the Supplementary
Material.

Conclusion: ENCORE通过动态反馈机制优化伪标签选择，有效提升了半监督学习的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning leverages unlabeled data to enhance model
performance, addressing the limitations of fully supervised approaches. Among
its strategies, pseudo-supervision has proven highly effective, typically
relying on one or multiple teacher networks to refine pseudo-labels before
training a student network. A common practice in pseudo-supervision is
filtering pseudo-labels based on pre-defined confidence thresholds or entropy.
However, selecting optimal thresholds requires large labeled datasets, which
are often scarce in real-world semi-supervised scenarios. To overcome this
challenge, we propose Ensemble-of-Confidence Reinforcement (ENCORE), a dynamic
feedback-driven thresholding strategy for pseudo-label selection. Instead of
relying on static confidence thresholds, ENCORE estimates class-wise
true-positive confidence within the unlabeled dataset and continuously adjusts
thresholds based on the model's response to different levels of pseudo-label
filtering. This feedback-driven mechanism ensures the retention of informative
pseudo-labels while filtering unreliable ones, enhancing model training without
manual threshold tuning. Our method seamlessly integrates into existing
pseudo-supervision frameworks and significantly improves segmentation
performance, particularly in data-scarce conditions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that integrating ENCORE with existing pseudo-supervision frameworks
enhances performance across multiple datasets and network architectures,
validating its effectiveness in semi-supervised learning.

Motivation: 基于事件的目标检测具有高时间分辨率、宽动态范围和异步事件表示等优势，而SNNs因其低能耗和时空动态特性成为有前景的方法。

Method: HsVT模型结合了空间特征提取模块（捕获局部和全局特征）和时间特征提取模块（建模时间依赖性和长期模式），以捕捉时空特征。

Result: 在GEN1和Fall Detection数据集上的实验表明，HsVT以较少的参数显著提升了事件检测性能。

Conclusion: HsVT模型通过整合时空特征提取模块，有效提升了基于事件的目标检测能力，并提供了公开数据集支持后续研究。

Abstract: Event-based object detection has gained increasing attention due to its
advantages such as high temporal resolution, wide dynamic range, and
asynchronous address-event representation. Leveraging these advantages, Spiking
Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising approach, offering low
energy consumption and rich spatiotemporal dynamics. To further enhance the
performance of event-based object detection, this study proposes a novel hybrid
spike vision Transformer (HsVT) model. The HsVT model integrates a spatial
feature extraction module to capture local and global features, and a temporal
feature extraction module to model time dependencies and long-term patterns in
event sequences. This combination enables HsVT to capture spatiotemporal
features, improving its capability to handle complex event-based object
detection tasks. To support research in this area, we developed and publicly
released The Fall Detection Dataset as a benchmark for event-based object
detection tasks. This dataset, captured using an event-based camera, ensures
facial privacy protection and reduces memory usage due to the event
representation format. We evaluated the HsVT model on GEN1 and Fall Detection
datasets across various model sizes. Experimental results demonstrate that HsVT
achieves significant performance improvements in event detection with fewer
parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TLDR: 论文提出了一种自动生成游戏高光时刻的方法，通过多模态视频理解模型X-CLIP，无需针对每款游戏单独开发，即可实现跨游戏的高光检测，准确率超过90%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为玩家节省时间并提高社交媒体上的观众参与度，传统方法需要与游戏开发者合作或针对每款游戏单独开发，成本高且泛化性差。

Method: 使用X-CLIP多模态模型，通过微调和提示工程，结合自建的游戏事件检测数据集，实现跨游戏的高光检测。

Result: 模型在未见过的第一人称射击游戏片段中检测高光时刻的准确率超过90%，且在低资源游戏中表现出迁移学习能力。

Conclusion: 自然语言监督的X-CLIP模型能高效且高性能地实现视频识别，适用于生产环境。

Abstract: In this work, we enable gamers to share their gaming experience on social
media by automatically generating eye-catching highlight reels from their
gameplay session Our automation will save time for gamers while increasing
audience engagement. We approach the highlight generation problem by first
identifying intervals in the video where interesting events occur and then
concatenate them. We developed an in-house gameplay event detection dataset
containing interesting events annotated by humans using VIA video annotator.
Traditional techniques for highlight detection such as game engine integration
requires expensive collaboration with game developers. OCR techniques which
detect patches of specific images or texts require expensive per game
engineering and may not generalize across game UI and different language. We
finetuned a multimodal general purpose video understanding model such as X-CLIP
using our dataset which generalizes across multiple games in a genre without
per game engineering. Prompt engineering was performed to improve the
classification performance of this multimodal model. Our evaluation showed that
such a finetuned model can detect interesting events in first person shooting
games from unseen gameplay footage with more than 90% accuracy. Moreover, our
model performed significantly better on low resource games (small dataset) when
trained along with high resource games, showing signs of transfer learning. To
make the model production ready, we used ONNX libraries to enable cross
platform inference. These libraries also provide post training quantization
tools to reduce model size and inference time for deployment. ONNX runtime
libraries with DirectML backend were used to perform efficient inference on
Windows OS. We show that natural language supervision in the X-CLIP model leads
to data efficient and highly performant video recognition models.

TLDR: LAMM-ViT是一种用于检测AI合成人脸的新方法，通过区域引导的多头注意力和层感知掩码调制，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉不同生成技术中面部区域的结构关系，导致对新型生成模型的检测效果不佳。

Method: 提出LAMM-ViT模型，结合区域引导多头注意力（RG-MHA）和层感知掩码调制（LAMM），动态调整区域关注度。

Result: 在跨模型测试中，LAMM-ViT平均准确率达94.09%（提升5.45%），平均AP达98.62%（提升3.09%）。

Conclusion: LAMM-ViT具有优异的泛化能力，能有效应对不断演变的合成媒体威胁。

Abstract: Detecting AI-synthetic faces presents a critical challenge: it is hard to
capture consistent structural relationships between facial regions across
diverse generation techniques. Current methods, which focus on specific
artifacts rather than fundamental inconsistencies, often fail when confronted
with novel generative models. To address this limitation, we introduce
Layer-aware Mask Modulation Vision Transformer (LAMM-ViT), a Vision Transformer
designed for robust facial forgery detection. This model integrates distinct
Region-Guided Multi-Head Attention (RG-MHA) and Layer-aware Mask Modulation
(LAMM) components within each layer. RG-MHA utilizes facial landmarks to create
regional attention masks, guiding the model to scrutinize architectural
inconsistencies across different facial areas. Crucially, the separate LAMM
module dynamically generates layer-specific parameters, including mask weights
and gating values, based on network context. These parameters then modulate the
behavior of RG-MHA, enabling adaptive adjustment of regional focus across
network depths. This architecture facilitates the capture of subtle,
hierarchical forgery cues ubiquitous among diverse generation techniques, such
as GANs and Diffusion Models. In cross-model generalization tests, LAMM-ViT
demonstrates superior performance, achieving 94.09% mean ACC (a +5.45%
improvement over SoTA) and 98.62% mean AP (a +3.09% improvement). These results
demonstrate LAMM-ViT's exceptional ability to generalize and its potential for
reliable deployment against evolving synthetic media threats.

Abstract: We introduce a new type of foundational model for parsing human anatomy in
medical images that works for different modalities. It supports supervised or
unsupervised training and can perform matching, registration, classification,

response times of less than 1 ms without additional accelerator hardware. We
demonstrate the utility of the algorithm in both CT and MRI modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D生成领域因数据稀缺、算法限制和生态系统碎片化而发展滞后，需要一种综合解决方案。

Method: Step1X-3D采用两阶段架构：混合VAE-DiT几何生成器和基于扩散的纹理合成模块，结合高质量数据集和开源工具。

Result: 框架在基准测试中表现优于现有开源方法，并与专有解决方案竞争，同时支持2D控制技术的直接迁移。

Conclusion: Step1X-3D通过提升数据质量、算法保真度和可复现性，为可控3D资产生成设立了新标准。

Abstract: While generative artificial intelligence has advanced significantly across
text, image, audio, and video domains, 3D generation remains comparatively
underdeveloped due to fundamental challenges such as data scarcity, algorithmic
limitations, and ecosystem fragmentation. To this end, we present Step1X-3D, an
open framework addressing these challenges through: (1) a rigorous data
curation pipeline processing >5M assets to create a 2M high-quality dataset
with standardized geometric and textural properties; (2) a two-stage 3D-native
architecture combining a hybrid VAE-DiT geometry generator with an
diffusion-based texture synthesis module; and (3) the full open-source release
of models, training code, and adaptation modules. For geometry generation, the
hybrid VAE-DiT component produces TSDF representations by employing
perceiver-based latent encoding with sharp edge sampling for detail
preservation. The diffusion-based texture synthesis module then ensures
cross-view consistency through geometric conditioning and latent-space
synchronization. Benchmark results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance
that exceeds existing open-source methods, while also achieving competitive
quality with proprietary solutions. Notably, the framework uniquely bridges the
2D and 3D generation paradigms by supporting direct transfer of 2D control
techniques~(e.g., LoRA) to 3D synthesis. By simultaneously advancing data
quality, algorithmic fidelity, and reproducibility, Step1X-3D aims to establish
new standards for open research in controllable 3D asset generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统自回归模型在连续视觉数据上因量化导致的信息损失问题。

Method: 采用严格适当评分规则作为训练目标，探索基于能量评分的无似然训练目标。

Result: 框架能够直接生成连续视觉数据，且兼容其他严格适当评分方法（如GIVT和扩散损失）。

Conclusion: Continuous VAR框架为连续视觉数据的自回归生成提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Conventional wisdom suggests that autoregressive models are used to process
discrete data. When applied to continuous modalities such as visual data,
Visual AutoRegressive modeling (VAR) typically resorts to quantization-based
approaches to cast the data into a discrete space, which can introduce
significant information loss. To tackle this issue, we introduce a Continuous
VAR framework that enables direct visual autoregressive generation without
vector quantization. The underlying theoretical foundation is strictly proper
scoring rules, which provide powerful statistical tools capable of evaluating
how well a generative model approximates the true distribution. Within this
framework, all we need is to select a strictly proper score and set it as the
training objective to optimize. We primarily explore a class of training
objectives based on the energy score, which is likelihood-free and thus
overcomes the difficulty of making probabilistic predictions in the continuous
space. Previous efforts on continuous autoregressive generation, such as GIVT
and diffusion loss, can also be derived from our framework using other strictly
proper scores. Source code: https://github.com/shaochenze/EAR.

TLDR: DanceGRPO是一个统一的强化学习框架，适用于多种生成模型和任务，显著提升了生成内容的质量和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管生成模型（如扩散模型和整流流）在视觉内容创作中取得了突破，但如何使其输出与人类偏好对齐仍是一个关键挑战。现有基于强化学习的方法存在局限性，如与现代ODE采样范式不兼容、训练不稳定以及缺乏视频生成的验证。

Method: DanceGRPO通过将Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）应用于视觉生成范式，实现了一个统一的强化学习算法，覆盖多种生成范式、任务、基础模型和奖励模型。

Result: DanceGRPO在多个基准测试中表现优异，性能提升高达181%，并能稳定优化复杂视频生成策略，同时支持稀疏二进制反馈学习。

Conclusion: DanceGRPO为视觉生成中的强化学习任务提供了稳健且通用的解决方案，为强化学习与视觉合成的结合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative models-particularly diffusion models and
rectified flows-have revolutionized visual content creation, yet aligning model
outputs with human preferences remains a critical challenge. Existing
reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods for visual generation face critical
limitations: incompatibility with modern Ordinary Differential Equations
(ODEs)-based sampling paradigms, instability in large-scale training, and lack
of validation for video generation. This paper introduces DanceGRPO, the first
unified framework to adapt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to visual
generation paradigms, unleashing one unified RL algorithm across two generative
paradigms (diffusion models and rectified flows), three tasks (text-to-image,
text-to-video, image-to-video), four foundation models (Stable Diffusion,
HunyuanVideo, FLUX, SkyReel-I2V), and five reward models (image/video
aesthetics, text-image alignment, video motion quality, and binary reward). To
our knowledge, DanceGRPO is the first RL-based unified framework capable of
seamless adaptation across diverse generative paradigms, tasks, foundational
models, and reward models. DanceGRPO demonstrates consistent and substantial
improvements, which outperform baselines by up to 181% on benchmarks such as
HPS-v2.1, CLIP Score, VideoAlign, and GenEval. Notably, DanceGRPO not only can
stabilize policy optimization for complex video generation, but also enables
generative policy to better capture denoising trajectories for Best-of-N
inference scaling and learn from sparse binary feedback. Our results establish
DanceGRPO as a robust and versatile solution for scaling Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF) tasks in visual generation, offering new insights
into harmonizing reinforcement learning and visual synthesis. The code will be
released.

TLDR: FINSABER框架评估了LLM在资产定价和股票交易中的表现，发现其在更长时间和更广股票范围内的优势显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在资产定价和股票交易中的泛化性和鲁棒性，揭示现有研究的局限性。

Method: 提出FINSABER框架，对20多年和100多只股票进行系统性回测。

Result: LLM策略在牛市保守、熊市激进，表现不佳，优势在更广范围内显著下降。

Conclusion: 需开发注重趋势检测和风险控制的LLM策略，而非仅增加框架复杂性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been leveraged for asset pricing
tasks and stock trading applications, enabling AI agents to generate investment
decisions from unstructured financial data. However, most evaluations of LLM
timing-based investing strategies are conducted on narrow timeframes and
limited stock universes, overstating effectiveness due to survivorship and
data-snooping biases. We critically assess their generalizability and
robustness by proposing FINSABER, a backtesting framework evaluating
timing-based strategies across longer periods and a larger universe of symbols.
Systematic backtests over two decades and 100+ symbols reveal that previously
reported LLM advantages deteriorate significantly under broader cross-section
and over a longer-term evaluation. Our market regime analysis further
demonstrates that LLM strategies are overly conservative in bull markets,
underperforming passive benchmarks, and overly aggressive in bear markets,
incurring heavy losses. These findings highlight the need to develop LLM
strategies that are able to prioritise trend detection and regime-aware risk
controls over mere scaling of framework complexity.

TLDR: 5G的增强安全性（如IPsec）可能影响其实时能力，但研究发现正确配置的IPsec对延迟影响极小，适合实时关键场景。WireGuard也被评估为潜在替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G的超可靠低延迟通信（URLLC）对实时场景至关重要，但其增强安全性可能带来性能开销，需评估其对延迟的影响。

Method: 测量IPsec在N3和服务接口上的延迟开销，并评估WireGuard作为替代方案的可行性。

Result: 正确配置的IPsec对延迟影响极小，适合实时关键场景。WireGuard的表现也被评估。

Conclusion: IPsec是保护5G实时关键场景的首选安全方案，WireGuard可作为潜在替代。

Abstract: In contrast to its predecessors, 5G supports a wide range of commercial,
industrial, and critical infrastructure scenarios. One key feature of 5G,
ultra-reliable low latency communication, is particularly appealing to such
scenarios for its real-time capabilities. However, 5G's enhanced security,
mostly realized through optional security controls, imposes additional overhead
on the network performance, potentially hindering its real-time capabilities.
To better assess this impact and guide operators in choosing between different
options, we measure the latency overhead of IPsec when applied over the N3 and
the service-based interfaces to protect user and control plane data,
respectively. Furthermore, we evaluate whether WireGuard constitutes an
alternative to reduce this overhead. Our findings show that IPsec, if
configured correctly, has minimal latency impact and thus is a prime candidate
to secure real-time critical scenarios.

Motivation: 量化环境因素对室内LoRaWAN信号传播的影响，优化网络可靠性。

Method: 在室内环境中部署LoRaWAN设备，测量信号强度指标，并改进Log-Distance路径损耗模型。

Result: 改进模型（LDPLSM-MW-EP）将RMSE从10.58 dB降至8.04 dB，R²从0.6917提升至0.8222。

Conclusion: 改进模型为室内IoT部署提供了优化信号传播和延长设备寿命的实用方法。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive dataset of LoRaWAN technology path loss
measurements collected in an indoor office environment, focusing on quantifying
the effects of environmental factors on signal propagation. Utilizing a network
of six strategically placed LoRaWAN end devices (EDs) and a single indoor
gateway (GW) at the University of Siegen, City of Siegen, Germany, we
systematically measured signal strength indicators such as the Received Signal
Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) under various
environmental conditions, including temperature, relative humidity, carbon
dioxide (CO$_2$) concentration, barometric pressure, and particulate matter
levels (PM$_{2.5}$). Our empirical analysis confirms that transient phenomena
such as reflections, scattering, interference, occupancy patterns (induced by
environmental parameter variations), and furniture rearrangements can alter
signal attenuation by as much as 10.58 dB, highlighting the dynamic nature of
indoor propagation. As an example of how this dataset can be utilized, we
tested and evaluated a refined Log-Distance Path Loss and Shadowing Model that
integrates both structural obstructions (Multiple Walls) and Environmental
Parameters (LDPLSM-MW-EP). Compared to a baseline model that considers only
Multiple Walls (LDPLSM-MW), the enhanced approach reduced the root mean square
error (RMSE) from 10.58 dB to 8.04 dB and increased the coefficient of
determination (R$^2$) from 0.6917 to 0.8222. By capturing the extra effects of
environmental conditions and occupancy dynamics, this improved model provides
valuable insights for optimizing power usage and prolonging device battery
life, enhancing network reliability in indoor Internet of Things (IoT)
deployments, among other applications. This dataset offers a solid foundation
for future research and development in indoor wireless communication.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统控制变量在高维问题中难以构建，NCV通过神经网络学习辅助函数减少方差，但自相关样本的作用常被忽视。

Method: 系统分析使用自相关样本训练NCV的效果，通过理论和数值实验验证其优势。

Result: 实验表明，自相关样本能提升NCV性能，尤其在资源有限时，并在U(1)规范理论和标量场理论中得到验证。

Conclusion: 研究为高效利用MCMC数据训练神经网络提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Neural control variates (NCVs) have emerged as a powerful tool for variance
reduction in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, particularly in high-dimensional
problems where traditional control variates are difficult to construct
analytically. By training neural networks to learn auxiliary functions
correlated with the target observable, NCVs can significantly reduce estimator
variance while preserving unbiasedness. However, a critical but often
overlooked aspect of NCV training is the role of autocorrelated samples
generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). While such samples are typically
discarded for error estimation due to their statistical redundancy, they may
contain useful information about the structure of the underlying probability
distribution that can benefit the training process. In this work, we
systematically examine the effect of using correlated configurations in
training neural control variates. We demonstrate, both conceptually and
numerically, that training on correlated data can improve control variate
performance, especially in settings with limited computational resources. Our
analysis includes empirical results from $U(1)$ gauge theory and scalar field
theory, illustrating when and how autocorrelated samples enhance NCV
construction. These findings provide practical guidance for the efficient use
of MCMC data in training neural networks.

Motivation: 解决大型多模态模型（LMMs）在情感场景中性能有限及微调时灾难性遗忘的问题。

Method: 采用混合专家（MoE）范式构建Hybrid Compressor，三阶段预训练，并构建Video Emotion Reasoning（VER）数据集。

Result: 在多个情感识别基准上达到最优性能，同时在通用视觉语言任务中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: Emotion-Qwen有效提升了情感理解与通用多模态推理能力。

Abstract: Emotion understanding in videos aims to accurately recognize and interpret
individuals' emotional states by integrating contextual, visual, textual, and
auditory cues. While Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated
significant progress in general vision-language (VL) tasks, their performance
in emotion-specific scenarios remains limited. Moreover, fine-tuning LMMs on
emotion-related tasks often leads to catastrophic forgetting, hindering their
ability to generalize across diverse tasks. To address these challenges, we
present Emotion-Qwen, a tailored multimodal framework designed to enhance both
emotion understanding and general VL reasoning. Emotion-Qwen incorporates a
sophisticated Hybrid Compressor based on the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm,
which dynamically routes inputs to balance emotion-specific and general-purpose
processing. The model is pre-trained in a three-stage pipeline on large-scale
general and emotional image datasets to support robust multimodal
representations. Furthermore, we construct the Video Emotion Reasoning (VER)
dataset, comprising more than 40K bilingual video clips with fine-grained
descriptive annotations, to further enrich Emotion-Qwen's emotional reasoning
capability. Experimental results demonstrate that Emotion-Qwen achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple emotion recognition benchmarks, while
maintaining competitive results on general VL tasks. Code and models are

Result: Pokenet在真实数据上的关节轴和状态估计性能提升20%以上，并在Sawyer机器人上验证了OKSMs的有效性。

Conclusion: OKSMs和Pokenet为多自由度物体的建模和操作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As robots become more generalized and deployed in diverse environments, they
must interact with complex objects, many with multiple independent joints or
degrees of freedom (DoF) requiring precise control. A common strategy is object
modeling, where compact state-space models are learned from real-world
observations and paired with classical planning. However, existing methods
often rely on prior knowledge or focus on single-DoF objects, limiting their
applicability. They also fail to handle occluded joints and ignore the
manipulation sequences needed to access them. We address this by learning
object models from human demonstrations. We introduce Object Kinematic Sequence
Machines (OKSMs), a novel representation capturing both kinematic constraints
and manipulation order for multi-DoF objects. To estimate these models from
point cloud data, we present Pokenet, a deep neural network trained on human
demonstrations. We validate our approach on 8,000 simulated and 1,600
real-world annotated samples. Pokenet improves joint axis and state estimation
by over 20 percent on real-world data compared to prior methods. Finally, we
demonstrate OKSMs on a Sawyer robot using inverse kinematics-based planning to
manipulate multi-DoF objects.

Abstract: In this paper, we present Optimized Prompt-based Unified System (OPUS), a
framework that utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to control Pan-Tilt-Zoom
(PTZ) cameras, providing contextual understanding of natural environments. To
achieve this goal, the OPUS system improves cost-effectiveness by generating
keywords from a high-level camera control API and transferring knowledge from
larger closed-source language models to smaller ones through Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on synthetic data. This enables efficient edge deployment
while maintaining performance comparable to larger models like GPT-4. OPUS
enhances environmental awareness by converting data from multiple cameras into
textual descriptions for language models, eliminating the need for specialized
sensory tokens. In benchmark testing, our approach significantly outperformed
both traditional language model techniques and more complex prompting methods,
achieving a 35% improvement over advanced techniques and a 20% higher task
accuracy compared to closed-source models like Gemini Pro. The system
demonstrates OPUS's capability to simplify PTZ camera operations through an
intuitive natural language interface. This approach eliminates the need for
explicit programming and provides a conversational method for interacting with
camera systems, representing a significant advancement in how users can control
and utilize PTZ camera technology.

Abstract: The aim of this work is to enable quadrupedal robots to mount skateboards
using Reverse Curriculum Reinforcement Learning. Although prior work has
demonstrated skateboarding for quadrupeds that are already positioned on the
board, the initial mounting phase still poses a significant challenge. A
goal-oriented methodology was adopted, beginning with the terminal phases of
the task and progressively increasing the complexity of the problem definition
to approximate the desired objective. The learning process was initiated with
the skateboard rigidly fixed within the global coordinate frame and the robot
positioned directly above it. Through gradual relaxation of these initial
conditions, the learned policy demonstrated robustness to variations in
skateboard position and orientation, ultimately exhibiting a successful
transfer to scenarios involving a mobile skateboard. The code, trained models,

Abstract: This paper presents JAEGER, a dual-level whole-body controller for humanoid
robots that addresses the challenges of training a more robust and versatile
policy. Unlike traditional single-controller approaches, JAEGER separates the
control of the upper and lower bodies into two independent controllers, so that
they can better focus on their distinct tasks. This separation alleviates the
dimensionality curse and improves fault tolerance. JAEGER supports both root
velocity tracking (coarse-grained control) and local joint angle tracking
(fine-grained control), enabling versatile and stable movements. To train the
controller, we utilize a human motion dataset (AMASS), retargeting human poses
to humanoid poses through an efficient retargeting network, and employ a
curriculum learning approach. This method performs supervised learning for
initialization, followed by reinforcement learning for further exploration. We
conduct our experiments on two humanoid platforms and demonstrate the
superiority of our approach against state-of-the-art methods in both simulation
and real environments.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种改进的强化学习奖励函数设计方法，通过层次化结构和归一化目标提升自动驾驶的安全性，并在无信号交叉口场景中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习奖励函数设计对安全性关注不足，仅将碰撞作为惩罚，忽略了导致碰撞的风险行为，限制了RL在现实场景中的应用。

Method: 提出层次化的奖励函数设计，引入归一化目标和基于二维椭球函数及RSS概念的风险感知目标。

Result: 在无信号交叉口场景中，该方法平均降低21%的碰撞率，并在路线进展和累积奖励上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 改进的奖励函数设计能显著提升自动驾驶的安全性和性能，适用于复杂交通场景。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a promising approach for achieving autonomous
driving due to robust decision-making capabilities. RL learns a driving policy
through trial and error in traffic scenarios, guided by a reward function that
combines the driving objectives. The design of such reward function has
received insufficient attention, yielding ill-defined rewards with various
pitfalls. Safety, in particular, has long been regarded only as a penalty for
collisions. This leaves the risks associated with actions leading up to a
collision unaddressed, limiting the applicability of RL in real-world
scenarios. To address these shortcomings, our work focuses on enhancing the
reward formulation by defining a set of driving objectives and structuring them
hierarchically. Furthermore, we discuss the formulation of these objectives in
a normalized manner to transparently determine their contribution to the
overall reward. Additionally, we introduce a novel risk-aware objective for
various driving interactions based on a two-dimensional ellipsoid function and
an extension of Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) concepts. We evaluate the
efficacy of our proposed reward in unsignalized intersection scenarios with
varying traffic densities. The approach decreases collision rates by 21\% on
average compared to baseline rewards and consistently surpasses them in route
progress and cumulative reward, demonstrating its capability to promote safer
driving behaviors while maintaining high-performance levels.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种新的轨迹预测框架，通过约束回归确保预测的可行性和合理性，显著减少了不可行轨迹和脱轨率。


<details>

Motivation: 自动驾驶中准确预测周围道路用户的轨迹至关重要，但现有方法在防止脱轨预测和确保运动学可行性方面存在不足。

Method: 利用HD地图和当前状态定义有效边界，训练网络学习边界之间的路径，并通过预测加速度剖面确保运动学可行性。

Result: 在Argoverse-2数据集上，与HPTR相比，最终位移误差减少，不可行轨迹消除，脱轨率从66%降至1%。

Conclusion: 该方法在生成可行且鲁棒的预测方面表现出色，尤其在罕见操作和未知场景中泛化能力更强。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of surrounding road users' trajectories is essential for
safe and efficient autonomous driving. While deep learning models have improved
performance, challenges remain in preventing off-road predictions and ensuring
kinematic feasibility. Existing methods incorporate road-awareness modules and
enforce kinematic constraints but lack plausibility guarantees and often
introduce trade-offs in complexity and flexibility. This paper proposes a novel
framework that formulates trajectory prediction as a constrained regression
guided by permissible driving directions and their boundaries. Using the
agent's current state and an HD map, our approach defines the valid boundaries
and ensures on-road predictions by training the network to learn superimposed
paths between left and right boundary polylines. To guarantee feasibility, the
model predicts acceleration profiles that determine the vehicle's travel
distance along these paths while adhering to kinematic constraints. We evaluate
our approach on the Argoverse-2 dataset against the HPTR baseline. Our approach
shows a slight decrease in benchmark metrics compared to HPTR but notably
improves final displacement error and eliminates infeasible trajectories.
Moreover, the proposed approach has superior generalization to less prevalent
maneuvers and unseen out-of-distribution scenarios, reducing the off-road rate
under adversarial attacks from 66\% to just 1\%. These results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in generating feasible and robust predictions.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种结合交互和运动学先验的方法，以提高自动驾驶中轨迹预测的可信度和物理可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在轨迹预测中缺乏可信度，预测结果可能不符合物理规律或人类逻辑。现有方法仅适用于单一交通参与者类别，无法推广到混合类别场景。

Method: 提出结合所有交通参与者类别（车辆、行人、自行车）的交互和运动学先验，使用类别特定的交互层捕捉行为差异，并引入DG-SFM评分提高交互可解释性。

Result: 在Argoverse 2数据集上验证，方法提高了交互可解释性，减少了不可行轨迹，尽管运动学模型略微降低了准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过可解释的交互推理和物理可行的预测，增强了轨迹预测的可信度。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to
navigate safely by anticipating the movements of surrounding road users.
However, current deep learning models often lack trustworthiness as their
predictions can be physically infeasible and illogical to humans. To make
predictions more trustworthy, recent research has incorporated prior knowledge,
like the social force model for modeling interactions and kinematic models for
physical realism. However, these approaches focus on priors that suit either
vehicles or pedestrians and do not generalize to traffic with mixed agent
classes. We propose incorporating interaction and kinematic priors of all agent
classes--vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists with class-specific interaction
layers to capture agent behavioral differences. To improve the interpretability
of the agent interactions, we introduce DG-SFM, a rule-based interaction
importance score that guides the interaction layer. To ensure physically
feasible predictions, we proposed suitable kinematic models for all agent
classes with a novel pedestrian kinematic model. We benchmark our approach on
the Argoverse 2 dataset, using the state-of-the-art transformer HPTR as our
baseline. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves interaction
interpretability, revealing a correlation between incorrect predictions and
divergence from our interaction prior. Even though incorporating the kinematic
models causes a slight decrease in accuracy, they eliminate infeasible
trajectories found in the dataset and the baseline model. Thus, our approach
fosters trust in trajectory prediction as its interaction reasoning is
interpretable, and its predictions adhere to physics.

Conclusion: CompSLAM为复杂环境提供了有效的定位与建图解决方案，并公开了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Robot autonomy in unknown, GPS-denied, and complex underground environments
requires real-time, robust, and accurate onboard pose estimation and mapping
for reliable operations. This becomes particularly challenging in
perception-degraded subterranean conditions under harsh environmental factors,
including darkness, dust, and geometrically self-similar structures. This paper
details CompSLAM, a highly resilient and hierarchical multi-modal localization
and mapping framework designed to address these challenges. Its flexible
architecture achieves resilience through redundancy by leveraging the
complementary nature of pose estimates derived from diverse sensor modalities.
Developed during the DARPA Subterranean Challenge, CompSLAM was successfully
deployed on all aerial, legged, and wheeled robots of Team Cerberus during
their competition-winning final run. Furthermore, it has proven to be a
reliable odometry and mapping solution in various subsequent projects, with
extensions enabling multi-robot map sharing for marsupial robotic deployments
and collaborative mapping. This paper also introduces a comprehensive dataset
acquired by a manually teleoperated quadrupedal robot, covering a significant
portion of the DARPA Subterranean Challenge finals course. This dataset
evaluates CompSLAM's robustness to sensor degradations as the robot traverses
740 meters in an environment characterized by highly variable geometries and
demanding lighting conditions. The CompSLAM code and the DARPA SubT Finals
dataset are made publicly available for the benefit of the robotics community

Result: 实验表明，LBP在仿真和真实机器人任务中优于现有方法，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: LBP通过后向规划和子目标条件策略，实现了高效且准确的机器人规划，适用于长时程多阶段任务。

Abstract: Current robotic planning methods often rely on predicting multi-frame images
with full pixel details. While this fine-grained approach can serve as a
generic world model, it introduces two significant challenges for downstream
policy learning: substantial computational costs that hinder real-time
deployment, and accumulated inaccuracies that can mislead action extraction.
Planning with coarse-grained subgoals partially alleviates efficiency issues.
However, their forward planning schemes can still result in off-task
predictions due to accumulation errors, leading to misalignment with long-term
goals. This raises a critical question: Can robotic planning be both efficient
and accurate enough for real-time control in long-horizon, multi-stage tasks?
To address this, we propose a Latent Space Backward Planning scheme (LBP),
which begins by grounding the task into final latent goals, followed by
recursively predicting intermediate subgoals closer to the current state. The
grounded final goal enables backward subgoal planning to always remain aware of
task completion, facilitating on-task prediction along the entire planning
horizon. The subgoal-conditioned policy incorporates a learnable token to
summarize the subgoal sequences and determines how each subgoal guides action
extraction. Through extensive simulation and real-robot long-horizon
experiments, we show that LBP outperforms existing fine-grained and forward
planning methods, achieving SOTA performance. Project Page:

Conclusion: FACET方法适用于复杂场景，如腿式移动操作器和人形机器人，实现了全身顺应性控制。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has made significant strides in legged robot
control, enabling locomotion across diverse terrains and complex
loco-manipulation capabilities. However, the commonly used position or velocity
tracking-based objectives are agnostic to forces experienced by the robot,
leading to stiff and potentially dangerous behaviors and poor control during
forceful interactions. To address this limitation, we present
\emph{Force-Adaptive Control via Impedance Reference Tracking} (FACET).
Inspired by impedance control, we use RL to train a control policy to imitate a
virtual mass-spring-damper system, allowing fine-grained control under external
forces by manipulating the virtual spring. In simulation, we demonstrate that
our quadruped robot achieves improved robustness to large impulses (up to 200
Ns) and exhibits controllable compliance, achieving an 80% reduction in
collision impulse. The policy is deployed to a physical robot to showcase both
compliance and the ability to engage with large forces by kinesthetic control
and pulling payloads up to 2/3 of its weight. Further extension to a legged
loco-manipulator and a humanoid shows the applicability of our method to more
complex settings to enable whole-body compliance control. Project Website:

characteristics of a specially designed lenticular circle on the landing pad,
where the perceived color and form provide critical information for estimating
both altitude and depth. Reinforcement learning algorithms are utilized to
approximate the functions governing these estimations, enabling the UAV to
ascertain ideal landing settings via training. This method's efficacy is
assessed by simulations and experiments, showcasing its potential for robust

Abstract: Perception is a core capability of automated vehicles and has been
significantly advanced through modern sensor technologies and artificial
intelligence. However, perception systems still face challenges in complex
real-world scenarios. To improve robustness against various external factors,
multi-sensor fusion techniques are essential, combining the strengths of
different sensor modalities. With recent developments in Vehicle-to-Everything
(V2X communication, sensor fusion can now extend beyond a single vehicle to a
cooperative multi-agent system involving Connected Automated Vehicle (CAV) and
intelligent infrastructure. This paper presents VALISENS, an innovative
multi-sensor system distributed across multiple agents. It integrates onboard
and roadside LiDARs, radars, thermal cameras, and RGB cameras to enhance
situational awareness and support cooperative automated driving. The thermal
camera adds critical redundancy for perceiving Vulnerable Road User (VRU),
while fusion with roadside sensors mitigates visual occlusions and extends the
perception range beyond the limits of individual vehicles. We introduce the
corresponding perception module built on this sensor system, which includes
object detection, tracking, motion forecasting, and high-level data fusion. The
proposed system demonstrates the potential of cooperative perception in
real-world test environments and lays the groundwork for future Cooperative

Abstract: Human videos offer a scalable way to train robot manipulation policies, but
lack the action labels needed by standard imitation learning algorithms.
Existing cross-embodiment approaches try to map human motion to robot actions,
but often fail when the embodiments differ significantly. We propose X-Sim, a
real-to-sim-to-real framework that uses object motion as a dense and
transferable signal for learning robot policies. X-Sim starts by reconstructing
a photorealistic simulation from an RGBD human video and tracking object
trajectories to define object-centric rewards. These rewards are used to train
a reinforcement learning (RL) policy in simulation. The learned policy is then
distilled into an image-conditioned diffusion policy using synthetic rollouts
rendered with varied viewpoints and lighting. To transfer to the real world,
X-Si introduces an online domain adaptation technique that aligns real and
simulated observations during deployment. Importantly, X-Sim does not require
any robot teleoperation data. We evaluate it across 5 manipulation tasks in 2
environments and show that it: (1) improves task progress by 30% on average
over hand-tracking and sim-to-real baselines, (2) matches behavior cloning with
10x less data collection time, and (3) generalizes to new camera viewpoints and
test-time changes. Code and videos are available at

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has shifted from static,
data-driven models to dynamic systems capable of perceiving and interacting
with real-world environments. Despite advancements in pattern recognition and
symbolic reasoning, current AI systems, such as large language models, remain
disembodied, unable to physically engage with the world. This limitation has
driven the rise of embodied AI, where autonomous agents, such as humanoid
robots, must navigate and manipulate unstructured environments with human-like
adaptability. At the core of this challenge lies the concept of Neural Brain, a
central intelligence system designed to drive embodied agents with human-like
adaptability. A Neural Brain must seamlessly integrate multimodal sensing and
perception with cognitive capabilities. Achieving this also requires an
adaptive memory system and energy-efficient hardware-software co-design,
enabling real-time action in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a
unified framework for the Neural Brain of embodied agents, addressing two
fundamental challenges: (1) defining the core components of Neural Brain and
(2) bridging the gap between static AI models and the dynamic adaptability
required for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose a biologically
inspired architecture that integrates multimodal active sensing,
perception-cognition-action function, neuroplasticity-based memory storage and
updating, and neuromorphic hardware/software optimization. Furthermore, we also
review the latest research on embodied agents across these four aspects and
analyze the gap between current AI systems and human intelligence. By
synthesizing insights from neuroscience, we outline a roadmap towards the
development of generalizable, autonomous agents capable of human-level
intelligence in real-world scenarios.

iteratively reflect on observations, revise mission goals, and coordinate
dynamically in evolving environments.
  UAV-CodeAgents is evaluated on large-scale mission scenarios involving
industrial and environmental fire detection. Our results show that a lower
decoding temperature (0.5) yields higher planning reliability and reduced
execution time, with an average mission creation time of 96.96 seconds and a
success rate of 93%. We further fine-tune Qwen2.5VL-7B on 9,000 annotated

raise privacy risks. To better understand user perceptions of privacy in
relation to visual data, we conducted a user study investigating how different
image modalities and image resolutions affect users' privacy concerns. The
results show that depth images are broadly viewed as privacy-safe, and a
similarly high proportion of respondents feel the same about semantic
segmentation images. Additionally, the majority of participants consider 32*32
resolution RGB images to be almost sufficiently privacy-preserving, while most
believe that 16*16 resolution can fully guarantee privacy protection.

*Tony Tao,Mohan Kumar Srirama,Jason Jingzhou Liu,Kenneth Shaw,Deepak Pathak*

Main category: cs.RO

TLDR: DexWild提出了一种低成本、易用的数据收集系统，通过人类手部动作收集多样化数据，结合机器人数据训练，显著提升了机器人在新环境中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模、多样化的机器人数据集是实现通用操作策略的关键，但传统遥操作成本高、难以扩展。DexWild探索了利用人类手部动作收集数据的低成本替代方案。

Method: 开发了DexWild-System设备，用于记录人类手部动作数据，并通过联合训练人类和机器人数据提升模型性能。

Result: 实验显示，DexWild在新环境中成功率提升至68.5%，是仅使用机器人数据训练的4倍，跨具身泛化能力提升5.8倍。

Conclusion: DexWild证明了人类数据与机器人数据联合训练的有效性，为低成本、可扩展的机器人学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large-scale, diverse robot datasets have emerged as a promising path toward
enabling dexterous manipulation policies to generalize to novel environments,
but acquiring such datasets presents many challenges. While teleoperation
provides high-fidelity datasets, its high cost limits its scalability. Instead,
what if people could use their own hands, just as they do in everyday life, to
collect data? In DexWild, a diverse team of data collectors uses their hands to
collect hours of interactions across a multitude of environments and objects.
To record this data, we create DexWild-System, a low-cost, mobile, and
easy-to-use device. The DexWild learning framework co-trains on both human and
robot demonstrations, leading to improved performance compared to training on
each dataset individually. This combination results in robust robot policies
capable of generalizing to novel environments, tasks, and embodiments with
minimal additional robot-specific data. Experimental results demonstrate that
DexWild significantly improves performance, achieving a 68.5% success rate in
unseen environments-nearly four times higher than policies trained with robot
data only-and offering 5.8x better cross-embodiment generalization. Video

Main category: cs.RO

TLDR: IVE框架利用视觉语言模型（VLMs）生成探索行为，通过想象、验证和执行实现多样化探索，效果优于强化学习基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放环境中，密集奖励或任务监督稀缺，探索对机器人学习至关重要。VLMs的语义推理能力为生成高级探索行为提供了基础。

Method: IVE框架将RGB-D观察抽象为语义场景图，想象新场景，预测其物理可行性，并通过动作工具生成可执行技能序列。

Result: IVE在模拟和真实环境中实现了比RL基线更丰富的探索，状态熵增加4.1至7.8倍，且支持下游学习任务。

Conclusion: IVE通过模仿人类好奇心驱动的探索行为，显著提升了机器人学习的多样性和效果。

Abstract: Exploration is essential for general-purpose robotic learning, especially in
open-ended environments where dense rewards, explicit goals, or task-specific
supervision are scarce. Vision-language models (VLMs), with their semantic
reasoning over objects, spatial relations, and potential outcomes, present a
compelling foundation for generating high-level exploratory behaviors. However,
their outputs are often ungrounded, making it difficult to determine whether
imagined transitions are physically feasible or informative. To bridge the gap
between imagination and execution, we present IVE (Imagine, Verify, Execute),
an agentic exploration framework inspired by human curiosity. Human exploration
is often driven by the desire to discover novel scene configurations and to
deepen understanding of the environment. Similarly, IVE leverages VLMs to
abstract RGB-D observations into semantic scene graphs, imagine novel scenes,
predict their physical plausibility, and generate executable skill sequences
through action tools. We evaluate IVE in both simulated and real-world tabletop
environments. The results show that IVE enables more diverse and meaningful
exploration than RL baselines, as evidenced by a 4.1 to 7.8x increase in the
entropy of visited states. Moreover, the collected experience supports
downstream learning, producing policies that closely match or exceed the
performance of those trained on human-collected demonstrations.

Main category: cs.RO

TLDR: LangToMo是一个双系统架构的视觉-语言-动作框架，通过像素运动预测作为中间表示，结合扩散模型和机器人控制，实现灵活、可扩展的通用机器人控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言、动作和机器人控制之间的鸿沟，提出一种通用、可解释的运动中心表示方法。

Method: 采用双系统架构：高层System 2（扩散模型）生成文本条件像素运动序列；低层System 1将运动映射为机器人动作。

Result: 实现了在无监督和半监督设置下的灵活、可扩展的机器人控制。

Conclusion: LangToMo通过分层解耦和通用表示，有效连接语言、运动和动作，为机器人控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present LangToMo, a vision-language-action framework structured as a
dual-system architecture that uses pixel motion forecasts as intermediate
representations. Our high-level System 2, an image diffusion model, generates
text-conditioned pixel motion sequences from a single frame to guide robot
control. Pixel motion-a universal, interpretable, and motion-centric
representation-can be extracted from videos in a self-supervised manner,
enabling diffusion model training on web-scale video-caption data. Treating
generated pixel motion as learned universal representations, our low level
System 1 module translates these into robot actions via motion-to-action
mapping functions, which can be either hand-crafted or learned with minimal
supervision. System 2 operates as a high-level policy applied at sparse
temporal intervals, while System 1 acts as a low-level policy at dense temporal
intervals. This hierarchical decoupling enables flexible, scalable, and
generalizable robot control under both unsupervised and supervised settings,
bridging the gap between language, motion, and action. Checkout

*Ce Hao,Anxing Xiao,Zhiwei Xue,Harold Soh*

Main category: cs.RO

TLDR: 提出了一种名为CHD的框架，通过联合建模高层子目标和低层轨迹，改进了扩散规划在长时任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散规划器在长时任务中表现不佳，主要原因是高层子目标与低层轨迹之间的耦合松散。

Method: 提出Coupled Hierarchical Diffusion (CHD)，在统一扩散过程中联合建模高层子目标和低层轨迹，并通过共享分类器传递低层反馈以修正子目标。

Result: 在迷宫导航、桌面操作和家庭环境等任务中，CHD均优于平面和分层扩散基线。

Conclusion: CHD通过紧密耦合高层与低层规划，显著提升了长时任务的扩散规划性能。

Abstract: Diffusion-based planners have shown strong performance in short-horizon tasks
but often fail in complex, long-horizon settings. We trace the failure to loose
coupling between high-level (HL) sub-goal selection and low-level (LL)
trajectory generation, which leads to incoherent plans and degraded
performance. We propose Coupled Hierarchical Diffusion (CHD), a framework that
models HL sub-goals and LL trajectories jointly within a unified diffusion
process. A shared classifier passes LL feedback upstream so that sub-goals
self-correct while sampling proceeds. This tight HL-LL coupling improves
trajectory coherence and enables scalable long-horizon diffusion planning.
Experiments across maze navigation, tabletop manipulation, and household
environments show that CHD consistently outperforms both flat and hierarchical
diffusion baselines.

TLDR: H$^{3}$DP是一种新型视觉运动学习框架，通过三层层次结构强化视觉特征与动作生成的耦合，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了视觉感知与动作预测的关键耦合关系，H$^{3}$DP旨在解决这一问题。

Method: H$^{3}$DP包含三层层次结构：深度感知输入分层、多尺度视觉表示和层次条件扩散过程。

Result: 在44个仿真任务中平均相对提升27.5%，并在4个真实世界双手机器人任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: H$^{3}$DP通过层次化设计显著提升了视觉运动策略学习的性能。

Abstract: Visuomotor policy learning has witnessed substantial progress in robotic
manipulation, with recent approaches predominantly relying on generative models
to model the action distribution. However, these methods often overlook the
critical coupling between visual perception and action prediction. In this
work, we introduce $\textbf{Triply-Hierarchical Diffusion
Policy}~(\textbf{H$^{\mathbf{3}}$DP})$, a novel visuomotor learning framework
that explicitly incorporates hierarchical structures to strengthen the
integration between visual features and action generation. H$^{3}$DP contains
$\mathbf{3}$ levels of hierarchy: (1) depth-aware input layering that organizes
RGB-D observations based on depth information; (2) multi-scale visual
representations that encode semantic features at varying levels of granularity;
and (3) a hierarchically conditioned diffusion process that aligns the
generation of coarse-to-fine actions with corresponding visual features.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that H$^{3}$DP yields a $\mathbf{+27.5\%}$
average relative improvement over baselines across $\mathbf{44}$ simulation
tasks and achieves superior performance in $\mathbf{4}$ challenging bimanual
real-world manipulation tasks. Project Page: https://lyy-iiis.github.io/h3dp/.

Motivation: 人形机器人在执行高难度平衡任务时面临参考运动误差、形态不匹配和仿真到现实的差距三大挑战，需要一种统一解决方案。

Method: 提出HuB框架，整合参考运动优化、平衡感知策略学习和仿真到现实鲁棒性训练，针对性地解决每个挑战。

Result: 在Unitree G1机器人上成功完成高难度平衡任务（如单腿平衡和李小龙式踢腿），即使在强物理干扰下仍保持稳定。

Conclusion: HuB框架有效解决了人形机器人平衡控制的核心问题，为复杂任务的实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The human body demonstrates exceptional motor capabilities-such as standing
steadily on one foot or performing a high kick with the leg raised over 1.5
meters-both requiring precise balance control. While recent research on
humanoid control has leveraged reinforcement learning to track human motions
for skill acquisition, applying this paradigm to balance-intensive tasks
remains challenging. In this work, we identify three key obstacles: instability
from reference motion errors, learning difficulties due to morphological
mismatch, and the sim-to-real gap caused by sensor noise and unmodeled
dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose HuB (Humanoid Balance), a
unified framework that integrates reference motion refinement, balance-aware
policy learning, and sim-to-real robustness training, with each component
targeting a specific challenge. We validate our approach on the Unitree G1
humanoid robot across challenging quasi-static balance tasks, including extreme
single-legged poses such as Swallow Balance and Bruce Lee's Kick. Our policy
remains stable even under strong physical disturbances-such as a forceful
soccer strike-while baseline methods consistently fail to complete these tasks.

TLDR: JaxRobotarium是一个基于Jax的多机器人强化学习平台，解决了MARBLER缺乏并行化和硬件加速的问题，显著提升了训练和仿真速度，并提供了标准化的机器人协调场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体强化学习（MARL）平台（如SMAC和MPE）缺乏机器人相关性和硬件部署支持，而MARBLER虽提供了标准化平台，但缺乏并行化和GPU/TPU执行能力，限制了其应用。

Method: 开发了JaxRobotarium平台，支持并行化和硬件加速，提供端到端的仿真、学习、部署和基准测试功能，并集成了SOTA MARL库和标准化机器人协调场景。

Result: JaxRobotarium在保持高仿真保真度的同时，实现了显著的性能提升（训练速度提升20倍，仿真速度提升150倍），并通过Robotarium测试床提供了开放的仿真到真实评估流程。

Conclusion: JaxRobotarium加速并普及了多机器人学习的研究和评估，为多机器人强化学习提供了高效且易用的平台。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a promising solution
for learning complex and scalable coordination behaviors in multi-robot
systems. However, established MARL platforms (e.g., SMAC and MPE) lack robotics
relevance and hardware deployment, leaving multi-robot learning researchers to
develop bespoke environments and hardware testbeds dedicated to the development
and evaluation of their individual contributions. The Multi-Agent RL Benchmark
and Learning Environment for the Robotarium (MARBLER) is an exciting recent
step in providing a standardized robotics-relevant platform for MARL, by
bridging the Robotarium testbed with existing MARL software infrastructure.
However, MARBLER lacks support for parallelization and GPU/TPU execution,
making the platform prohibitively slow compared to modern MARL environments and
hindering adoption. We contribute JaxRobotarium, a Jax-powered end-to-end
simulation, learning, deployment, and benchmarking platform for the Robotarium.
JaxRobotarium enables rapid training and deployment of multi-robot
reinforcement learning (MRRL) policies with realistic robot dynamics and safety
constraints, supporting both parallelization and hardware acceleration. Our
generalizable learning interface provides an easy-to-use integration with SOTA
MARL libraries (e.g., JaxMARL). In addition, JaxRobotarium includes eight
standardized coordination scenarios, including four novel scenarios that bring
established MARL benchmark tasks (e.g., RWARE and Level-Based Foraging) to a
realistic robotics setting. We demonstrate that JaxRobotarium retains high
simulation fidelity while achieving dramatic speedups over baseline (20x in
training and 150x in simulation), and provides an open-access sim-to-real
evaluation pipeline through the Robotarium testbed, accelerating and
democratizing access to multi-robot learning research and evaluation.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于2D LiDAR的机器学习控制方法，用于生成真实的反事实解释（CFEs），帮助理解黑盒模型决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型（如神经网络）在移动机器人控制中表现优异，但其黑盒特性难以解释，尤其在安全关键应用中。

Method: 通过遗传算法参数化LiDAR空间（如圆形和矩形），生成合成LiDAR数据作为CFEs，以模拟特定模型输出。

Result: 在TurtleBot3机器人上验证，生成逻辑且真实的CFEs，有效解释了深度强化学习（DRL）的决策。

Conclusion: 该方法推动了移动机器人中可解释AI的发展，为理解、调试和改进机器学习控制提供了工具。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for generating realistic counterfactual
explanations (CFEs) in machine learning (ML)-based control for mobile robots
using 2D LiDAR. ML models, especially artificial neural networks (ANNs), can
provide advanced decision-making and control capabilities by learning from
data. However, they often function as black boxes, making it challenging to
interpret them. This is especially a problem in safety-critical control
applications. To generate realistic CFEs, we parameterize the LiDAR space with
simple shapes such as circles and rectangles, whose parameters are chosen by a
genetic algorithm, and the configurations are transformed into LiDAR data by
raycasting. Our model-agnostic approach generates CFEs in the form of synthetic
LiDAR data that resembles a base LiDAR state but is modified to produce a
pre-defined ML model control output based on a query from the user. We
demonstrate our method on a mobile robot, the TurtleBot3, controlled using deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) in real-world and simulated scenarios. Our method
generates logical and realistic CFEs, which helps to interpret the DRL agent's
decision making. This paper contributes towards advancing explainable AI in
mobile robotics, and our method could be a tool for understanding, debugging,
and improving ML-based autonomous control.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种基于分解缩放曲线（FSC）的方法，用于优化模仿学习策略的数据收集，以提高策略在新环境中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了确保模仿学习策略在不同条件下的泛化能力，通常需要收集大量数据覆盖各种环境因素变化，但这种方法成本高昂且不切实际。

Method: 通过构建分解缩放曲线（FSC），量化策略性能随单个或成对因素数据量的变化，从而有针对性地在预算内收集最具影响力的因素组合数据。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在模拟和真实环境中均显著提升策略性能，成功率达到26%的提升。

Conclusion: 分解缩放曲线是一种有效的工具，可指导数据收集，无需大规模真实环境评估。

Abstract: Generalist imitation learning policies trained on large datasets show great
promise for solving diverse manipulation tasks. However, to ensure
generalization to different conditions, policies need to be trained with data
collected across a large set of environmental factor variations (e.g., camera
pose, table height, distractors) $-$ a prohibitively expensive undertaking, if
done exhaustively. We introduce a principled method for deciding what data to
collect and how much to collect for each factor by constructing factored
scaling curves (FSC), which quantify how policy performance varies as data
scales along individual or paired factors. These curves enable targeted data
acquisition for the most influential factor combinations within a given budget.
We evaluate the proposed method through extensive simulated and real-world
experiments, across both training-from-scratch and fine-tuning settings, and
show that it boosts success rates in real-world tasks in new environments by up
to 26% over existing data-collection strategies. We further demonstrate how
factored scaling curves can effectively guide data collection using an offline
metric, without requiring real-world evaluation at scale.

Result: 在仿真和真实硬件上，新方法显著优于基线，能处理超出分布边界条件并避开更大障碍物。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了生成模型在轨迹规划中的性能，尤其在复杂任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Generative models have shown great promise as trajectory planners, given
their affinity to modeling complex distributions and guidable inference
process. Previous works have successfully applied these in the context of
robotic manipulation but perform poorly when the required solution does not
exist as a complete trajectory within the training set. We identify that this
is a result of being unable to plan via stitching, and subsequently address the
architectural and dataset choices needed to remedy this. On top of this, we
propose a novel addition to the training and inference procedures to both
stabilize and enhance these capabilities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach by generating plans with out of distribution boundary conditions and
performing obstacle avoidance on the Franka Panda in simulation and on real
hardware. In both of these tasks our method performs significantly better than
the baselines and is able to avoid obstacles up to four times as large.

Abstract: Road accidents significantly threaten public safety and require in-depth
analysis for effective prevention and mitigation strategies. This paper focuses
on predicting accidents through the examination of a comprehensive traffic
dataset covering 49 states in the United States. The dataset integrates
information from diverse sources, including transportation departments, law
enforcement, and traffic sensors. This paper specifically emphasizes predicting
the number of accidents, utilizing advanced machine learning models such as
regression analysis and time series analysis. The inclusion of various factors,
ranging from environmental conditions to human behavior and infrastructure,
ensures a holistic understanding of the dynamics influencing road safety.
Temporal and spatial analysis further allows for the identification of trends,
seasonal variations, and high-risk areas. The implications of this research
extend to proactive decision-making for policymakers and transportation
authorities. By providing accurate predictions and quantifiable insights into
expected accident rates under different conditions, the paper aims to empower
authorities to allocate resources efficiently and implement targeted
interventions. The goal is to contribute to the development of informed
policies and interventions that enhance road safety, creating a safer
environment for all road users. Keywords: Machine Learning, Random Forest,

Abstract: In the context of the new mandatory labor compliance in the European Union
(EU), which will be implemented in 2027, supply chain enterprises face
stringent working hour management requirements and compliance risks. In order
to scientifically predict the enterprises' coping behaviors and performance
outcomes under the policy impact, this paper constructs a methodological
framework that integrates the AI synthetic data generation mechanism and
structural path regression modeling to simulate the enterprises' strategic
transition paths under the new regulations. In terms of research methodology,
this paper adopts high-quality simulation data generated based on Monte Carlo
mechanism and NIST synthetic data standards to construct a structural path
analysis model that includes multiple linear regression, logistic regression,
mediation effect and moderating effect. The variable system covers 14
indicators such as enterprise working hours, compliance investment, response
speed, automation level, policy dependence, etc. The variable set with
explanatory power is screened out through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and
VIF multicollinearity elimination. The findings show that compliance investment
has a significant positive impact on firm survival and its effect is
transmitted through the mediating path of the level of intelligence; meanwhile,
firms' dependence on the EU market significantly moderates the strength of this
mediating effect. It is concluded that AI synthetic data combined with
structural path modeling provides an effective tool for high-intensity
regulatory simulation, which can provide a quantitative basis for corporate
strategic response, policy design and AI-assisted decision-making in the
pre-prediction stage lacking real scenario data. Keywords: AI synthetic data,

Motivation: 生成式人工智能潜力巨大，但企业在规模化应用时面临技术复杂性、治理缺口和资源错配等挑战，需探索EAM如何解决这些问题。

Method: 基于系统性文献综述和对16位专家的半结构化访谈，采用Gioia方法分析数据，研究EAM与GenAI采用的关系。

Result: 发现EAM通过动态能力（感知、捕捉、转化）可提升GenAI采用，但需针对数据治理成熟度低等挑战定制框架。

Conclusion: EAM在创新与治理间架桥，需改进现有框架以支持GenAI采用，为学术和行业实践提供指导。

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence is a powerful new technology with the
potential to boost innovation and reshape governance in many industries.
Nevertheless, organisations face major challenges in scaling GenAI, including
technology complexity, governance gaps and resource misalignments. This study
explores how Enterprise Architecture Management can meet the complex
requirements of GenAI adoption within large enterprises. Based on a systematic
literature review and the qualitative analysis of 16 semi-structured interviews
with experts, it examines the relationships between EAM, dynamic capabilities
and GenAI adoption. The review identified key limitations in existing EA
frameworks, particularly their inability to fully address the unique
requirements of GenAI. The interviews, analysed using the Gioia methodology,
revealed critical enablers and barriers to GenAI adoption across industries.
The findings indicate that EAM, when theorised as sensing, seizing and
transforming dynamic capabilities, can enhance GenAI adoption by improving
strategic alignment, governance frameworks and organisational agility. However,
the study also highlights the need to tailor EA frameworks to GenAI-specific
challenges, including low data governance maturity and the balance between
innovation and compliance. Several conceptual frameworks are proposed to guide
EA leaders in aligning GenAI maturity with organisational readiness. The work
contributes to academic understanding and industry practice by clarifying the
role of EA in bridging innovation and governance in disruptive technology
environments.

explored in this field. This study seeks to empirically validate the
effectiveness of the Odychess Approach in improving chess knowledge, strategic
understanding, and metacognitive skills in students. A quasi-experimental study
was conducted with a pre-test/post-test design and a control group (N=60). The
experimental intervention implemented the Odychess Approach, incorporating a
Llama 3.3 language model that was specifically adapted using
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques to act as a Socratic chess
tutor. Quantitative assessment instruments were used to measure chess
knowledge, strategic understanding, and metacognitive skills before and after
the intervention. The results of the quasi-experimental study showed
significant improvements in the experimental group compared to the control
group in the three variables analyzed: chess knowledge, strategic
understanding, and metacognitive skills. The complementary qualitative analysis
revealed greater analytical depth, more developed dialectical reasoning, and
increased intrinsic motivation in students who participated in the Odychess
method-based intervention. The Odychess Approach represents an effective
pedagogical methodology for teaching chess, demonstrating the potential of the
synergistic integration of constructivist and dialectical principles with
generative artificial intelligence. The implications of this work are relevant
for educators and institutions interested in adopting innovative pedagogical
technologies and for researchers in the field of AI applied to education,
highlighting the transferability of the language model adaptation methodology
to other educational domains.

Main category: cs.CY

TLDR: 论文指出，尽管街景图像（DSI）提供商通过模糊人脸和车牌保护隐私，但数据密度的增加和AI技术的进步仍可能导致敏感群体信息被推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着DSI数据集的快速增长，隐私保护措施未能解决更广泛的隐私问题，尤其是在群体成员身份推断方面。

Method: 通过对纽约市25,232,608张行车记录仪图像进行渗透测试，展示如何从模糊的行人中推断敏感群体信息。

Result: 研究发现，即使数据经过匿名化处理，仍可通过AI技术推断出敏感群体身份。

Conclusion: 论文提出针对DSI数据研究者的可行建议，强调隐私保护需结合上下文完整性。

Abstract: Spatially and temporally dense street imagery (DSI) datasets have grown
unbounded. In 2024, individual companies possessed around 3 trillion unique
images of public streets. DSI data streams are only set to grow as companies
like Lyft and Waymo use DSI to train autonomous vehicle algorithms and analyze
collisions. Academic researchers leverage DSI to explore novel approaches to
urban analysis. Despite good-faith efforts by DSI providers to protect
individual privacy through blurring faces and license plates, these measures
fail to address broader privacy concerns. In this work, we find that increased
data density and advancements in artificial intelligence enable harmful group
membership inferences from supposedly anonymized data. We perform a penetration
test to demonstrate how easily sensitive group affiliations can be inferred
from obfuscated pedestrians in 25,232,608 dashcam images taken in New York
City. We develop a typology of identifiable groups within DSI and analyze
privacy implications through the lens of contextual integrity. Finally, we
discuss actionable recommendations for researchers working with data from DSI
providers.

TLDR: 研究探讨了工业界在AI采用中对环境可持续性的关注及法规对绿色AI实践的影响，发现企业对可持续性重视不足，法规效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI的广泛应用，其对环境的负面影响日益显著，但工业界在AI采用中对环境可持续性的角色及法规的影响尚不明确。

Method: 通过11次访谈，调查了10家采用AI的企业的实践，聚焦AI采用、环境影响缓解及法规影响。

Result: 多数企业优先考虑业务效率，环境可持续性关注极少；法规（如EU AI Act和CSRD）影响有限。

Conclusion: 需提高工业界对绿色AI的意识，并提供实用工具；现行法规效果不足，政策制定者需改进。

Abstract: With the ever-growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), AI-based
software and its negative impact on the environment are no longer negligible,
and studying and mitigating this impact has become a critical area of research.
However, it is currently unclear which role environmental sustainability plays
during AI adoption in industry and how AI regulations influence Green AI
practices and decision-making in industry. We therefore aim to investigate the
Green AI perception and management of industry practitioners. To this end, we
conducted a total of 11 interviews with participants from 10 different
organizations that adopted AI-based software. The interviews explored three
main themes: AI adoption, current efforts in mitigating the negative
environmental impact of AI, and the influence of the EU AI Act and the
Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). Our findings indicate that
9 of 11 participants prioritized business efficiency during AI adoption, with
minimal consideration of environmental sustainability. Monitoring and
mitigation of AI's environmental impact were very limited. Only one participant
monitored negative environmental effects. Regarding applied mitigation
practices, six participants reported no actions, with the others sporadically
mentioning techniques like prompt engineering, relying on smaller models, or
not overusing AI. Awareness and compliance with the EU AI Act are low, with
only one participant reporting on its influence, while the CSRD drove
sustainability reporting efforts primarily in larger companies. All in all, our
findings reflect a lack of urgency and priority for sustainable AI among these
companies. We suggest that current regulations are not very effective, which
has implications for policymakers. Additionally, there is a need to raise
industry awareness, but also to provide user-friendly techniques and tools for
Green AI practices.

Motivation: 研究肯定性算法是否能纠正历史不公，并了解公众对其的态度。

Method: 通过两项实验（N=1193）对比人们对肯定性算法、歧视性算法和公平算法的看法。

Result: 自由派和少数族裔对肯定性算法评价高，而保守派和主流族裔评价低，分歧源于对边缘化群体的认知差异。

Conclusion: 研究提出通过弥合认知分歧，推动公众对肯定性算法的接受。

Abstract: Affirmative algorithms have emerged as a potential answer to algorithmic
discrimination, seeking to redress past harms and rectify the source of
historical injustices. We present the results of two experiments ($N$$=$$1193$)
capturing laypeople's perceptions of affirmative algorithms -- those which
explicitly prioritize the historically marginalized -- in hiring and criminal
justice. We contrast these opinions about affirmative algorithms with folk
attitudes towards algorithms that prioritize the privileged (i.e.,
discriminatory) and systems that make decisions independently of demographic
groups (i.e., fair). We find that people -- regardless of their political
leaning and identity -- view fair algorithms favorably and denounce
discriminatory systems. In contrast, we identify disagreements concerning
affirmative algorithms: liberals and racial minorities rate affirmative systems
as positively as their fair counterparts, whereas conservatives and those from
the dominant racial group evaluate affirmative algorithms as negatively as
discriminatory systems. We identify a source of these divisions: people have
varying beliefs about who (if anyone) is marginalized, shaping their views of
affirmative algorithms. We discuss the possibility of bridging these
disagreements to bring people together towards affirmative algorithms.

Conclusion: 论文为大型语言模型的学术讨论提供了专业视角的补充。

Abstract: In November 2022, Europe and the world by and large were stunned by the birth
of a new large language model : ChatGPT. Ever since then, both academic and
populist discussions have taken place in various public spheres such as
LinkedIn and X(formerly known as Twitter) with the view to both understand the
tool and its benefits for the society. The views of real actors in professional
spaces, especially in regulated industries such as finance and law have been
largely missing. We aim to begin to close this gap by presenting results from
an empirical investigation conducted through interviews with professional
actors in the Fintech industry. The paper asks the question, how and to what
extent are large language models in general and ChatGPT in particular being
adopted and used in the Fintech industry? The results show that while the
fintech experts we spoke with see a potential in using large language models in
the future, a lot of questions marks remain concerning how they are policed and
therefore might be adopted in a regulated industry such as Fintech. This paper
aims to add to the existing academic discussing around large language models,
with a contribution to our understanding of professional viewpoints.

Main category: cs.SE

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Adversarial Knowledge Distillation (AKD)的新方法，通过对抗生成的合成数据集，将大型模型的能力蒸馏到更小、更高效的模型中，以解决Code-LLMs在质量、安全和可靠性方面的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Code-LLMs（如GitHub Copilot）的广泛应用，其生成的代码质量、安全性和可靠性问题日益凸显，同时模型扩展的收益递减和高质量训练数据的稀缺性也带来了挑战。

Method: 采用Adversarial Knowledge Distillation (AKD)方法，利用对抗生成的合成数据集，将大型模型的能力蒸馏到更小、更高效的模型中，并通过系统性的压力测试和优化提升模型的鲁棒性、可靠性和安全性。

Result: AKD框架能够提升Code-LLMs的参数效率，同时增强其鲁棒性、可靠性和安全性。

Conclusion: 该研究为在现有数据和成本效率约束下实现可靠的自动化代码生成迈出了关键一步。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation,
exemplified by GitHub Copilot\footnote{A coding extension powered by a Code-LLM
to assist in code completion tasks} surpassing a million users, highlights the
transformative potential of these tools in improving developer productivity.
However, this rapid growth also underscores critical concerns regarding the
quality, safety, and reliability of the code they generate. As Code-LLMs
evolve, they face significant challenges, including the diminishing returns of
model scaling and the scarcity of new, high-quality training data. To address
these issues, this paper introduces Adversarial Knowledge Distillation (AKD), a
novel approach that leverages adversarially generated synthetic datasets to
distill the capabilities of larger models into smaller, more efficient ones. By
systematically stress-testing and refining the reasoning capabilities of
Code-LLMs, AKD provides a framework for enhancing model robustness,
reliability, and security while improving their parameter-efficiency. We
believe this work represents a critical step toward ensuring dependable
automated code generation within the constraints of existing data and the
cost-efficiency of model execution.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种通过代码注释交互优化LLM生成代码的方法，显著提升了代码准确性和开发者效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的代码存在功能错误，开发者难以检查和修复，影响了生产力和信任。

Method: 利用代码注释作为媒介，通过迭代生成代码、注释和用户反馈，建立共享理解。

Result: 在HumanEval基准上提升17.1% pass@1，用户研究显示任务完成速度提升16.7%，成功率提高10.5%。

Conclusion: 交互式注释优化能有效提升代码生成准确性和开发者信心。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capability in
code generation. However, LLM-generated code is still plagued with a wide range
of functional errors, especially for complex programming tasks that LLMs have
not seen before. Recent studies have shown that developers often struggle with
inspecting and fixing incorrect code generated by LLMs, diminishing their
productivity and trust in LLM-based code generation. Inspired by the mutual
grounding theory in communication, we propose an interactive approach that
leverages code comments as a medium for developers and LLMs to establish a
shared understanding. Our approach facilitates iterative grounding by
interleaving code generation, inline comment generation, and contextualized
user feedback through editable comments to align generated code with developer
intent. We evaluated our approach on two popular benchmarks and demonstrated
that our approach significantly improved multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g.,
17.1% pass@1 improvement for code-davinci-002 on HumanEval. Furthermore, we
conducted a user study with 12 participants in comparison to two baselines: (1)
interacting with GitHub Copilot, and (2) interacting with a multi-step code
generation paradigm called Multi-Turn Program Synthesis. Participants completed
the given programming tasks 16.7% faster and with 10.5% improvement in task
success rate when using our approach. Both results show that interactively
refining code comments enables the collaborative establishment of mutual
grounding, leading to more accurate code generation and higher developer
confidence.

TLDR: 本文提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLMs）生成合成数据以增强自动程序修复（APR）的新方法，解决了现有APR系统因高质量训练数据不足而受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前APR系统受限于跨多种编程语言和错误类型的高质量训练数据的稀缺性。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：首先生成合成样本，随后进行严格的质量评估。使用多个先进LLMs生成约30,000对错误和修复代码示例，覆盖12种编程语言和13种错误类别，并通过五项标准进行跨模型评估。

Result: 实验表明，质量过滤后的合成数据集在VulRepair测试集上显著提升了完美预测率，某些场景下优于基线和真实提交数据配置。

Conclusion: 研究确立了LLMs生成和评估自身训练数据的自举范式，有望解决软件工程任务中的数据稀缺问题，推动自动化代码维护工具的进步。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for enhancing Automated Program
Repair (APR) through synthetic data generation utilizing Large Language Models
(LLMs). Current APR systems are constrained by the limited availability of
high-quality training data encompassing diverse bug types across multiple
programming languages. The proposed approach addresses this limitation through
a two-phase process: a synthetic sample generation followed by a rigorous
quality assessment. Multiple state-of-the-art LLMs were employed to generate
approximately 30,000 paired examples of buggy and fixed code across 12
programming languages and 13 bug categories. Subsequently, these samples
underwent cross-model evaluation against five criteria: correctness, code
quality, security, performance, and completeness. Experimental evaluation on
the VulRepair test set dataset showed statistically significant improvements in
Perfect Prediction rates, with the quality-filtered synthetic dataset
outperforming both baseline and real-world commit data configurations in
certain scenarios. The methodology was validated through rigorous statistical
testing, including ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey's Honest Significant Difference
analysis. Furthermore, the best-performing configurations surpassed existing
systems despite using a less computationally intensive decoding strategy. This
research establishes a self-bootstrapping paradigm in which LLMs generate and
evaluate their own training data, potentially transforming approaches to data
scarcity across software engineering tasks and advancing the development of
robust, adaptable tools for automated code maintenance.

Conclusion: 本文为复杂领域特定应用中RAG系统的需求工程提供了新见解，强调了用户参与和迭代实验的重要性。

Abstract: This short paper explores how a maritime company develops and integrates
large-language models (LLM). Specifically by looking at the requirements
engineering for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in expert
settings. Through a case study at a maritime service provider, we demonstrate
how data scientists face a fundamental tension between user expectations of AI
perfection and the correctness of the generated outputs. Our findings reveal
that data scientists must identify context-specific "retrieval requirements"
through iterative experimentation together with users because they are the ones
who can determine correctness. We present an empirical process model describing
how data scientists practically elicited these "retrieval requirements" and
managed system limitations. This work advances software engineering knowledge
by providing insights into the specialized requirements engineering processes
for implementing RAG systems in complex domain-specific applications.

Abstract: The broad availability of generative AI offers new opportunities to support
various work domains, including agile software development. Agile epics are a
key artifact for product managers to communicate requirements to stakeholders.
However, in practice, they are often poorly defined, leading to churn, delivery
delays, and cost overruns. In this industry case study, we investigate
opportunities for large language models (LLMs) to evaluate agile epic quality
in a global company. Results from a user study with 17 product managers
indicate how LLM evaluations could be integrated into their work practices,
including perceived values and usage in improving their epics. High levels of
satisfaction indicate that agile epics are a new, viable application of AI
evaluations. However, our findings also outline challenges, limitations, and
adoption barriers that can inform both practitioners and researchers on the
integration of such evaluations into future agile work practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于Linux内核配置的复杂性和快速演变，缺乏大规模、多版本的详细数据集，阻碍了相关研究。

Method: 通过自动化工具和构建过程收集了240,000多个内核配置，并记录了编译结果和二进制大小。

Result: 数据集通过OpenML提供，支持特征选择、机器学习预测和跨版本迁移学习。

Conclusion: LinuxData将促进可重复性研究，并为内核配置分析提供新见解。

Abstract: Configuring the Linux kernel to meet specific requirements, such as binary
size, is highly challenging due to its immense complexity-with over 15,000
interdependent options evolving rapidly across different versions. Although
several studies have explored sampling strategies and machine learning methods
to understand and predict the impact of configuration options, the literature
still lacks a comprehensive and large-scale dataset encompassing multiple
kernel versions along with detailed quantitative measurements. To bridge this
gap, we introduce LinuxData, an accessible collection of kernel configurations
spanning several kernel releases, specifically from versions 4.13 to 5.8. This
dataset, gathered through automated tools and build processes, comprises over
240,000 kernel configurations systematically labeled with compilation outcomes
and binary sizes. By providing detailed records of configuration evolution and
capturing the intricate interplay among kernel options, our dataset enables
innovative research in feature subset selection, prediction models based on
machine learning, and transfer learning across kernel versions. Throughout this
paper, we describe how the dataset has been made easily accessible via OpenML
and illustrate how it can be leveraged using only a few lines of Python code to
evaluate AI-based techniques, such as supervised machine learning. We
anticipate that this dataset will significantly enhance reproducibility and
foster new insights into configuration-space analysis at a scale that presents
unique opportunities and inherent challenges, thereby advancing our
understanding of the Linux kernel's configurability and evolution.

Motivation: 针对病态问题的优化收敛速度慢的问题，结合Krylov子空间和随机梯度下降技术，提出更高效的解决方案。

Method: 结合单次流式Gauss-Seidel迭代计算投影系数、Chebyshev多项式基构建Krylov子空间，以及针对AMD GPU的高效实现。

Result: 实验表明，SKA-SGD在收敛速度和最终误差上显著优于标准SGD和Adam，尤其适用于条件数超过10^3的问题。

Conclusion: SKA-SGD通过低复杂度实现高精度，适用于中等规模问题，GPU性能分析显示其在通信避免方面的优势。

Abstract: We present SKA-SGD (Streaming Krylov-Accelerated Stochastic Gradient
Descent), a novel optimization approach that accelerates convergence for
ill-conditioned problems by projecting stochastic gradients onto a
low-dimensional Krylov subspace. Directly inspired by recent advances in s-step
Conjugate Gradient methods with streaming Gauss-Seidel Gram solvers
\cite{dambra2025sstep}, our method extends these techniques to the stochastic
optimization domain. Our approach combines three key innovations: (1)
projection coefficients computed via a single streaming Gauss-Seidel iteration,
which is mathematically equivalent to Modified Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization;
(2) a Chebyshev polynomial basis for constructing the Krylov subspace,
providing superior numerical stability; and (3) efficient implementation for
AMD GPUs using HIP. We prove that our streaming approach achieves a backward
error near machine precision with $O(s^2)$ complexity rather than $O(s^3)$,
where $s$ is the Krylov subspace dimension. Experimental results demonstrate
that SKA-SGD significantly outperforms standard SGD and Adam in convergence
rate and final error, particularly for problems with condition numbers
exceeding $10^3$. GPU performance analysis reveals a crossover point where
communication-avoiding benefits outweigh computational overhead, typically
occurring at moderate scale ($p \approx 64$ processors) for problem sizes $n
\geq 10^6$.

Conclusion: 为基于严格分析和高效学习的自适应PDE求解器开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for solving nonlinear PDEs using sparse radial
basis function (RBF) networks. Sparsity-promoting regularization is employed to
prevent over-parameterization and reduce redundant features. This work is
motivated by longstanding challenges in traditional RBF collocation methods,
along with the limitations of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and
Gaussian process (GP) approaches, aiming to blend their respective strengths in
a unified framework. The theoretical foundation of our approach lies in the
function space of Reproducing Kernel Banach Spaces (RKBS) induced by
one-hidden-layer neural networks of possibly infinite width. We prove a
representer theorem showing that the solution to the sparse optimization
problem in the RKBS admits a finite solution and establishes error bounds that
offer a foundation for generalizing classical numerical analysis. The
algorithmic framework is based on a three-phase algorithm to maintain
computational efficiency through adaptive feature selection, second-order
optimization, and pruning of inactive neurons. Numerical experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and highlight cases where it offers
notable advantages over GP approaches. This work opens new directions for
adaptive PDE solvers grounded in rigorous analysis with efficient,
learning-inspired implementation.

Motivation: 解决从实验数据中发现和更新材料模型的挑战，支持多种模型类型，促进未来材料模型架构的集成和应用。

Result: ADiMU成功更新了从几十到数百万参数的不同模型，在局部和全局发现中均表现出鲁棒性和多功能性。

Conclusion: ADiMU为材料模型研究提供了高效、通用的工具，并通过开源软件HookeAI支持社区研究和应用。

Abstract: We introduce the first Automatically Differentiable Model Updating (ADiMU)
framework that finds any history-dependent material model from full-field
displacement and global force data (global, indirect discovery) or from
strain-stress data (local, direct discovery). We show that ADiMU can update
conventional (physics-based), neural network (data-driven), and hybrid material
models. Moreover, this framework requires no fine-tuning of hyperparameters or
additional quantities beyond those inherent to the user-selected material model
architecture and optimizer. The robustness and versatility of ADiMU is
extensively exemplified by updating different models spanning tens to millions
of parameters, in both local and global discovery settings. Relying on fully
differentiable code, the algorithmic implementation leverages vectorizing maps
that enable history-dependent automatic differentiation via efficient batched
execution of shared computation graphs. This contribution also aims to
facilitate the integration, evaluation and application of future material model
architectures by openly supporting the research community. Therefore, ADiMU is
released as an open-source computational tool, integrated into a carefully
designed and documented software named HookeAI.

Abstract: We propose an automated framework for quantum circuit design by integrating

rigidity, scalability limitations, and expert dependence of traditional ones in
variational quantum algorithms. Our approach (FunSearch) autonomously discovers
hardware-efficient ans\"atze with new features of scalability and
system-size-independent number of variational parameters entirely from scratch.
Demonstrations on the Ising and XY spin chains with n = 9 qubits yield circuits
containing 4 parameters, achieving near-exact energy extrapolation across
system sizes. Implementations on quantum hardware (Zuchongzhi chip) validate
practicality, where two-qubit quantum gate noises can be effectively mitigated
via zero-noise extrapolations for a spin chain system as large as 20 sites.
This framework bridges algorithmic design and experimental constraints,
complementing contemporary quantum architecture search frameworks to advance
scalable quantum simulations.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence have highlighted the remarkable
capabilities of neural network (NN)-powered systems on classical computers.
However, these systems face significant computational challenges that limit
scalability and efficiency. Quantum computers hold the potential to overcome
these limitations and increase processing power beyond classical systems.
Despite this, integrating quantum computing with NNs remains largely unrealized
due to challenges posed by noise, decoherence, and high error rates in current
quantum hardware. Here, we propose a novel quantum echo-state network (QESN)
design and implementation algorithm that can operate within the presence of
noise on current IBM hardware. We apply classical control-theoretic response
analysis to characterize the QESN, emphasizing its rich nonlinear dynamics and
memory, as well as its ability to be fine-tuned with sparsity and re-uploading
blocks. We validate our approach through a comprehensive demonstration of QESNs
functioning as quantum observers, applied in both high-fidelity simulations and
hardware experiments utilizing data from a prototypical chaotic Lorenz system.
Our results show that the QESN can predict long time-series with persistent
memory, running over 100 times longer than the median T}1 and T2 of the IBM
Marrakesh QPU, achieving state-of-the-art time-series performance on
superconducting hardware.

TLDR: 论文探讨了量子计算中的错误校正问题，提出了一种基于神经网络和变换器的方法来改进3D环面码的解码性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子计算中的错误传播速度快，可能导致结果无效，因此需要高效且鲁棒的错误校正方法。

Result: 提出的方法在解码性能上优于传统方法，并能从指数增长的训练空间中高效学习。

Conclusion: 神经网络和变换器在量子错误校正中具有潜力，能够提高解码的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Mitigating errors in computing and communication systems has seen a great
deal of research since the beginning of the widespread use of these
technologies. However, as we develop new methods to do computation or
communication, we also need to reiterate the method used to deal with errors.
Within the field of quantum computing, error correction is getting a lot of
attention since errors can propagate fast and invalidate results, which makes
the theoretical exponential speed increase in computation time, compared to
traditional systems, obsolete. To correct errors in quantum systems,
error-correcting codes are used. A subgroup of codes, topological codes, is
currently the focus of many research papers. Topological codes represent parity
check matrices corresponding to graphs embedded on a $d$-dimensional surface.
For our research, the focus lies on the toric code with a 3D square lattice.
The goal of any decoder is robustness to noise, which can increase with code
size. However, a reasonable decoder performance scales polynomially with
lattice size. As error correction is a time-sensitive operation, we propose a
neural network using an inductive bias: equivariance. This allows the network
to learn from a rather small subset of the exponentially growing training space
of possible inputs. In addition, we investigate how transformer networks can
help in correction. These methods will be compared with various configurations
and previously published methods of decoding errors in the 3D toric code.

Method: 基于纠缠和解纠缠能力的理论，将量子RNN和LSTM建模为信息保留与遗忘机制，优化量子电路参数。

Result: 提出了一种量子-经典混合框架，可指导设计更优参数化的量子电路。

Conclusion: 通过结合量子纠缠理论，量子LSTM框架有望提升实际应用中的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss how quantum recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and
their enhanced version, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, can be modeled
using the core ideas presented in Ref.[1], where the entangling and
disentangling power of unitary transformations is investigated. In particular,
we interpret entangling and disentangling power as information retention and
forgetting mechanisms in LSTMs. Therefore, entanglement becomes a key component
of the optimization (training) process. We believe that, by leveraging prior
knowledge of the entangling power of unitaries, the proposed quantum-classical
framework can guide and help to design better-parameterized quantum circuits
for various real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解开放量子系统中的耗散对开发稳健的量子技术至关重要。

Method: 利用可观测量的时间序列（如单泡利算符的期望值）作为输入，结合Transformer架构和轻量级特征提取技术，学习耗散动态。

Result: 方法在多种复杂度的开放量子模型中有效，包括单量子比特、双量子比特相互作用系统及Jaynes-Cummings模型，能准确重构固定和时间依赖性衰减率。

Conclusion: 现代机器学习工具可作为识别开放量子系统中未知环境的可扩展和数据驱动替代方案。

Abstract: Understanding dissipation in open quantum systems is crucial for the
development of robust quantum technologies. In this work, we introduce a
Transformer-based machine learning framework to infer time-dependent
dissipation rates in quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation.
Our approach uses time series of observable quantities, such as expectation
values of single Pauli operators, as input to learn dissipation profiles
without requiring knowledge of the initial quantum state or even the system
Hamiltonian.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a hierarchy of open
quantum models of increasing complexity, including single-qubit systems with
time-independent or time-dependent jump rates, two-qubit interacting systems
(e.g., Heisenberg and transverse Ising models), and the Jaynes--Cummings model
involving light--matter interaction and cavity loss with time-dependent decay
rates. Our method accurately reconstructs both fixed and time-dependent decay
rates from observable time series. To support this, we prove that under
reasonable assumptions, the jump rates in all these models are uniquely
determined by a finite set of observables, such as qubit and photon
measurements. In practice, we combine Transformer-based architectures with
lightweight feature extraction techniques to efficiently learn these dynamics.
Our results suggest that modern machine learning tools can serve as scalable
and data-driven alternatives for identifying unknown environments in open
quantum systems.

TLDR: 提出了一种精确的自旋消除技术，降低二次和k-local Ising哈密顿量的维度，同时保留其原始基态配置。通过系统性地用有效相互作用替换移除的自旋，该方法无需近似或迭代计算即可减少总自旋数，适用于资源受限的硬件平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决硬件资源受限（如量子或经典计算平台）下实现多体相互作用的挑战，同时扩展组合优化和基于能量的机器学习在近期硬件上的应用范围。

Method: 通过系统性地替换移除的自旋为邻居间的有效相互作用，降低自旋总数，同时保持基态配置不变。

Result: 1. 在不超出2-local相互作用限制的情况下处理更大规模的Max-Cut问题；2. 减少QAOA整数分解的量子比特需求；3. 提升Hopfield联想记忆的存储容量和检索性能。

Conclusion: 该技术为组合优化和机器学习在近期硬件上的扩展提供了新途径，并表明下一代物理自旋机器可能利用k-local自旋哈密顿量作为经典计算的替代方案。

Abstract: We present an exact spin-elimination technique that reduces the
dimensionality of both quadratic and k-local Ising Hamiltonians while
preserving their original ground-state configurations. By systematically
replacing each removed spin with an effective interaction among its neighbors,
our method lowers the total spin count without invoking approximations or
iterative recalculations. This capability is especially beneficial for
hardware-constrained platforms, classical or quantum, that can directly
implement multi-body interactions but have limited qubit or spin resources. We
demonstrate three key advances enabled by this technique. First, we handle
larger instances of benchmark problems such as Max-Cut on cubic graphs without
exceeding a 2-local interaction limit. Second, we reduce qubit requirements in
QAOA-based integer factorization on near-term quantum devices, thus extending
the feasible range of integers to be factorized. Third, we improve memory
capacity in Hopfield associative memories and enhance memory retrieval by
suppressing spurious attractors, enhancing retrieval performance. Our
spin-elimination procedure trades local spin complexity for higher-order
couplings or higher node degrees in a single pass, opening new avenues for
scaling up combinatorial optimization and energy-based machine learning on
near-term hardware. Finally, these results underscore that the next-generation
physical spin machines will likely capitalize on k-local spin Hamiltonians to
offer an alternative to classical computations.

features relative to the traditional Internet, and emerging applications. Next,
we analyze the key operational enablers of IoA, including capability
notification and discovery, adaptive communication protocols, dynamic task

Conclusion: 这是DM技术在计算神经解剖学中的首次应用，有助于连接单轴突骨架和示踪剂注射数据。

Abstract: To understand biological intelligence we need to map neuronal networks in
vertebrate brains. Mapping mesoscale neural circuitry is done using injections
of tracers that label groups of neurons whose axons project to different brain
regions. Since many neurons are labeled, it is difficult to follow individual
axons. Previous approaches have instead quantified the regional projections
using the total label intensity within a region. However, such a quantification
is not biologically meaningful. We propose a new approach better connected to
the underlying neurons by skeletonizing labeled axon fragments and then
estimating a volumetric length density. Our approach uses a combination of deep
nets and the Discrete Morse (DM) technique from computational topology. This
technique takes into account nonlocal connectivity information and therefore
provides noise-robustness. We demonstrate the utility and scalability of the
approach on whole-brain tracer injected data. We also define and illustrate an
information theoretic measure that quantifies the additional information
obtained, compared to the skeletonized tracer injection fragments, when
individual axon morphologies are available. Our approach is the first
application of the DM technique to computational neuroanatomy. It can help
bridge between single-axon skeletons and tracer injections, two important data
types in mapping neural networks in vertebrates.

Conclusion: 从人类感知角度揭示了LLM的感官差距，并提出了一种增强多模态LLM感知能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Audio large language models (LLMs) are considered experts at recognizing
sound objects, yet their performance relative to LLMs in other sensory
modalities, such as visual or audio-visual LLMs, and to humans using their
ears, eyes, or both remains unexplored. To investigate this, we systematically
evaluate audio, visual, and audio-visual LLMs, specifically Qwen2-Audio,
Qwen2-VL, and Qwen2.5-Omni, against humans in recognizing sound objects of
different classes from audio-only, silent video, or sounded video inputs. We
uncover a performance gap between Qwen2-Audio and Qwen2-VL that parallels the
sensory discrepancy between human ears and eyes. To reduce this gap, we
introduce a cross-modal distillation framework, where an LLM in one modality
serves as the teacher and another as the student, with knowledge transfer in
sound classes predicted as more challenging to the student by a heuristic
model. Distillation in both directions, from Qwen2-VL to Qwen2-Audio and vice
versa, leads to notable improvements, particularly in challenging classes. This
work highlights the sensory gap in LLMs from a human-aligned perspective and
proposes a principled approach to enhancing modality-specific perception in
multimodal LLMs.

Conclusion: LE2E是低资源设备实时高质量语音合成的可行方案。

Abstract: Recent works have shown that modelling raw waveform directly from text in an
end-to-end (E2E) fashion produces more natural-sounding speech than traditional
neural text-to-speech (TTS) systems based on a cascade or two-stage approach.
However, current E2E state-of-the-art models are computationally complex and
memory-consuming, making them unsuitable for real-time offline on-device
applications in low-resource scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a
Lightweight E2E-TTS (LE2E) model that generates high-quality speech requiring
minimal computational resources. We evaluate the proposed model on the LJSpeech
dataset and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance while being up
to $90\%$ smaller in terms of model parameters and $10\times$ faster in
real-time-factor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed E2E training
paradigm achieves better quality compared to an equivalent architecture trained
in a two-stage approach. Our results suggest that LE2E is a promising approach
for developing real-time, high quality, low-resource TTS applications for
on-device applications.

Abstract: Lung cancer is the leading cause of patient mortality in the world. Early
diagnosis of malignant pulmonary nodules in CT images can have a significant
impact on reducing disease mortality and morbidity. In this work, we propose
LMLCC-Net, a novel deep learning framework for classifying nodules from CT scan
images using a 3D CNN, considering Hounsfield Unit (HU)-based intensity
filtering. Benign and malignant nodules have significant differences in their
intensity profile of HU, which was not exploited in the literature. Our method
considers the intensity pattern as well as the texture for the prediction of
malignancies. LMLCC-Net extracts features from multiple branches that each use
a separate learnable HU-based intensity filtering stage. Various combinations
of branches and learnable ranges of filters were explored to finally produce
the best-performing model. In addition, we propose a semi-supervised learning
scheme for labeling ambiguous cases and also developed a lightweight model to
classify the nodules. The experimental evaluations are carried out on the
LUNA16 dataset. Our proposed method achieves a classification accuracy (ACC) of
91.96%, a sensitivity (SEN) of 92.04%, and an area under the curve (AUC) of
91.87%, showing improved performance compared to existing methods. The proposed
method can have a significant impact in helping radiologists in the
classification of pulmonary nodules and improving patient care.

Abstract: Machine Learning, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), has
revolutionised Super Resolution (SR). However, generated images often lack
physical meaningfulness, which is essential for scientific applications. Our
approach, PC-SRGAN, enhances image resolution while ensuring physical
consistency for interpretable simulations. PC-SRGAN significantly improves both
the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio and the Structural Similarity Index Measure
compared to conventional methods, even with limited training data (e.g., only
13% of training data required for SRGAN). Beyond SR, PC-SRGAN augments
physically meaningful machine learning, incorporating numerically justified
time integrators and advanced quality metrics. These advancements promise
reliable and causal machine-learning models in scientific domains. A
significant advantage of PC-SRGAN over conventional SR techniques is its
physical consistency, which makes it a viable surrogate model for
time-dependent problems. PC-SRGAN advances scientific machine learning,
offering improved accuracy and efficiency for image processing, enhanced
process understanding, and broader applications to scientific research. The

Conclusion: HistDiST在保持结构一致性的同时，有效捕捉了IHC的分子语义，为病理学提供了一种高效的工具。

Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining is the cornerstone of histopathology but
lacks molecular specificity. While Immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides
molecular insights, it is costly and complex, motivating H&E-to-IHC translation
as a cost-effective alternative. Existing translation methods are mainly
GAN-based, often struggling with training instability and limited structural
fidelity, while diffusion-based approaches remain underexplored. We propose
HistDiST, a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) based framework for high-fidelity
H&E-to-IHC translation. HistDiST introduces a dual-conditioning strategy,
utilizing Phikon-extracted morphological embeddings alongside VAE-encoded H&E
representations to ensure pathology-relevant context and structural
consistency. To overcome brightness biases, we incorporate a rescaled noise
schedule, v-prediction, and trailing timesteps, enforcing a zero-SNR condition
at the final timestep. During inference, DDIM inversion preserves the
morphological structure, while an eta-cosine noise schedule introduces
controlled stochasticity, balancing structural consistency and molecular
fidelity. Moreover, we propose Molecular Retrieval Accuracy (MRA), a novel
pathology-aware metric leveraging GigaPath embeddings to assess molecular
relevance. Extensive evaluations on MIST and BCI datasets demonstrate that
HistDiST significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 28%
improvement in MRA on the H&E-to-Ki67 translation task, highlighting its
effectiveness in capturing true IHC semantics.

TLDR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的无掩码框架，用于估计MRSI代谢图中的缺失数据，优于传统插值方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRSI在脑代谢物非侵入性映射中具有重要作用，但常因数据缺失或损坏而受限。

Method: 采用2D和3D U-Net架构，通过上下文空间特征隐式检测和估计缺失区域，并引入渐进式训练策略。

Result: 2D模型在20%缺失体素下MSE为0.002，SSIM为0.97；3D模型在15%缺失体素下MSE为0.001，SSIM为0.98。

Conclusion: 该方法在真实数据集上表现优异，无需重新训练或掩码输入，具有临床和研究应用潜力。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) is a powerful tool for
non-invasive mapping of brain metabolites, providing critical insights into
neurological conditions. However, its utility is often limited by missing or
corrupted data due to motion artifacts, magnetic field inhomogeneities, or
failed spectral fitting-especially in high resolution 3D acquisitions. To
address this, we propose the first deep learning-based, mask-free framework for
estimating missing data in MRSI metabolic maps. Unlike conventional restoration
methods that rely on explicit masks to identify missing regions, our approach
implicitly detects and estimates these areas using contextual spatial features
through 2D and 3D U-Net architectures. We also introduce a progressive training
strategy to enhance robustness under varying levels of data degradation. Our
method is evaluated on both simulated and real patient datasets and
consistently outperforms traditional interpolation techniques such as cubic and
linear interpolation. The 2D model achieves an MSE of 0.002 and an SSIM of 0.97
with 20% missing voxels, while the 3D model reaches an MSE of 0.001 and an SSIM
of 0.98 with 15% missing voxels. Qualitative results show improved fidelity in
estimating missing data, particularly in metabolically heterogeneous regions
and ventricular regions. Importantly, our model generalizes well to real-world
datasets without requiring retraining or mask input. These findings demonstrate
the effectiveness and broad applicability of mask-free deep learning for MRSI
restoration, with strong potential for clinical and research integration.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic solution for the intelligent recognition and
automatic analysis of microscopy images. We developed a data engine that
generates high-quality annotated datasets through a combination of the
collection of diverse microscopy images from experiments, synthetic data
generation and a human-in-the-loop annotation process. To address the unique
challenges of microscopy images, we propose a segmentation model capable of
robustly detecting both small and large objects. The model effectively
identifies and separates thousands of closely situated targets, even in
cluttered visual environments. Furthermore, our solution supports the precise
automatic recognition of image scale bars, an essential feature in quantitative
microscopic analysis. Building upon these components, we have constructed a
comprehensive intelligent analysis platform and validated its effectiveness and
practicality in real-world applications. This study not only advances automatic
recognition in microscopy imaging but also ensures scalability and
generalizability across multiple application domains, offering a powerful tool
for automated microscopic analysis in interdisciplinary research.

Motivation: 图像似然估计在应用中很重要，但传统方法计算复杂。

Method: 引入Whitened CLIP，通过可逆线性变换将CLIP潜在空间白化，使其特征符合标准正态分布。

Result: 白化后的嵌入空间统计特性接近标准正态分布，似然估计简化为欧几里得距离平方。

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练，计算快速，适用于图像和文本的似然估计。

Abstract: Likelihood approximations for images are not trivial to compute and can be
useful in many applications. We examine the use of Contrastive Language-Image
Pre-training (CLIP) to assess the likelihood of images and captions. We
introduce \textit{Whitened CLIP}, a novel transformation of the CLIP latent
space via an invertible linear operation. This transformation ensures that each
feature in the embedding space has zero mean, unit standard deviation, and no
correlation with all other features, resulting in an identity covariance
matrix. We show that the whitened embeddings statistics can be well
approximated as a standard normal distribution, thus, the log-likelihood is
estimated simply by the square Euclidean norm in the whitened embedding space.
The whitening procedure is completely training-free and performed using a
pre-computed whitening matrix, hence, is very fast. We present several
preliminary experiments demonstrating the properties and applicability of these
likelihood scores to images and captions.

Abstract: Evaluating generative models for synthetic medical imaging is crucial yet
challenging, especially given the high standards of fidelity, anatomical
accuracy, and safety required for clinical applications. Standard evaluation of
generated images often relies on no-reference image quality metrics when ground
truth images are unavailable, but their reliability in this complex domain is
not well established. This study comprehensively assesses commonly used
no-reference image quality metrics using brain MRI data, including tumour and
vascular images, providing a representative exemplar for the field. We
systematically evaluate metric sensitivity to a range of challenges, including
noise, distribution shifts, and, critically, localised morphological
alterations designed to mimic clinically relevant inaccuracies. We then compare
these metric scores against model performance on a relevant downstream
segmentation task, analysing results across both controlled image perturbations
and outputs from different generative model architectures. Our findings reveal
significant limitations: many widely-used no-reference image quality metrics
correlate poorly with downstream task suitability and exhibit a profound
insensitivity to localised anatomical details crucial for clinical validity.
Furthermore, these metrics can yield misleading scores regarding distribution
shifts, e.g. data memorisation. This reveals the risk of misjudging model
readiness, potentially leading to the deployment of flawed tools that could
compromise patient safety. We conclude that ensuring generative models are
truly fit for clinical purpose requires a multifaceted validation framework,
integrating performance on relevant downstream tasks with the cautious
interpretation of carefully selected no-reference image quality metrics.

Method: MP-ViT使用两个独立的变换器编码器处理轴向和矢状面数据，并通过交叉注意力整合信息，同时引入模态指示向量补充缺失对比信息。

Result: 在真实临床数据集上，MP-ViT的AUC比ViT提升5.5%，比CNN架构提升1.8%。

Conclusion: MP-ViT在需要不同方向对比的脑出血检测中表现出显著潜力。

Abstract: Identifying brain hemorrhages from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a
critical task for healthcare professionals. The diverse nature of MRI
acquisitions with varying contrasts and orientation introduce complexity in
identifying hemorrhage using neural networks. For acquisitions with varying
orientations, traditional methods often involve resampling images to a fixed
plane, which can lead to information loss. To address this, we propose a 3D
multi-plane vision transformer (MP-ViT) for hemorrhage classification with
varying orientation data. It employs two separate transformer encoders for
axial and sagittal contrasts, using cross-attention to integrate information
across orientations. MP-ViT also includes a modality indication vector to
provide missing contrast information to the model. The effectiveness of the
proposed model is demonstrated with extensive experiments on real world
clinical dataset consists of 10,084 training, 1,289 validation and 1,496 test
subjects. MP-ViT achieved substantial improvement in area under the curve
(AUC), outperforming the vision transformer (ViT) by 5.5% and CNN-based
architectures by 1.8%. These results highlight the potential of MP-ViT in
improving performance for hemorrhage detection when different orientation
contrasts are needed.

Abstract: In ophthalmic surgery, developing an AI system capable of interpreting
surgical videos and predicting subsequent operations requires numerous
ophthalmic surgical videos with high-quality annotations, which are difficult
to collect due to privacy concerns and labor consumption. Text-guided video
generation (T2V) emerges as a promising solution to overcome this issue by
generating ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. In this
paper, we present Ophora, a pioneering model that can generate ophthalmic
surgical videos following natural language instructions. To construct Ophora,
we first propose a Comprehensive Data Curation pipeline to convert narrative
ophthalmic surgical videos into a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising
over 160K video-instruction pairs, Ophora-160K. Then, we propose a Progressive
Video-Instruction Tuning scheme to transfer rich spatial-temporal knowledge
from a T2V model pre-trained on natural video-text datasets for
privacy-preserved ophthalmic surgical video generation based on Ophora-160K.
Experiments on video quality evaluation via quantitative analysis and
ophthalmologist feedback demonstrate that Ophora can generate realistic and
reliable ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. We also
validate the capability of Ophora for empowering downstream tasks of ophthalmic
surgical workflow understanding. Code is available at

Motivation: 乳腺癌保乳手术需要平衡彻底切除和健康组织保留，术中边缘评估是关键。DUV-FSM能快速获取组织图像，但高分辨率和复杂特征增加了分类难度。

Method: 采用基于patch-level的ViT模型，结合Grad-CAM++显著性加权，捕捉局部和全局特征。

Result: 通过5折交叉验证，分类准确率达98.33%，优于传统深度学习方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在乳腺癌分类中表现出色，具有高准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) aims to completely remove malignant lesions
while maximizing healthy tissue preservation. Intraoperative margin assessment
is essential to achieve a balance between thorough cancer resection and tissue
conservation. A deep ultraviolet fluorescence scanning microscope (DUV-FSM)
enables rapid acquisition of whole surface images (WSIs) for excised tissue,
providing contrast between malignant and normal tissues. However, breast cancer
classification with DUV WSIs is challenged by high resolutions and complex
histopathological features. This study introduces a DUV WSI classification
framework using a patch-level vision transformer (ViT) model, capturing local
and global features. Grad-CAM++ saliency weighting highlights relevant spatial
regions, enhances result interpretability, and improves diagnostic accuracy for
benign and malignant tissue classification. A comprehensive 5-fold
cross-validation demonstrates the proposed approach significantly outperforms
conventional deep learning methods, achieving a classification accuracy of
98.33%.

TLDR: SparseAttnNet是一种高效的图像分类框架，通过动态选择最相关的像素点，显著减少计算量，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络处理整个图像，效率低且可能关注无关特征。SparseAttnNet旨在通过选择性处理像素点提升效率和解释性。

Method: 使用动态选择机制，结合粗粒度和细粒度注意力，选择最相关的k个像素点，并将其嵌入语言模型中捕获语义。

Result: 在多种细胞图像模态下，仅处理15%的像素点即可达到与传统方法相当的精度，同时大幅减少计算资源消耗。

Conclusion: SparseAttnNet在资源受限和高通量场景中具有显著优势，同时提升了模型的解释性。

Abstract: We present SparseAttnNet, a new hierarchical attention-driven framework for
efficient image classification that adaptively selects and processes only the
most informative pixels from images. Traditional convolutional neural networks
typically process the entire images regardless of information density, leading
to computational inefficiency and potential focus on irrelevant features. Our
approach leverages a dynamic selection mechanism that uses coarse attention
distilled by fine multi-head attention from the downstream layers of the model,
allowing the model to identify and extract the most salient k pixels, where k
is adaptively learned during training based on loss convergence trends. Once
the top-k pixels are selected, the model processes only these pixels, embedding
them as words in a language model to capture their semantics, followed by
multi-head attention to incorporate global context. For biological cell images,
we demonstrate that SparseAttnNet can process approximately 15% of the pixels
instead of the full image. Applied to cell classification tasks using white
blood cells images from the following modalities: optical path difference (OPD)
images from digital holography for stain-free cells, images from
motion-sensitive (event) camera from stain-free cells, and brightfield
microscopy images of stained cells, For all three imaging modalities,
SparseAttnNet achieves competitive accuracy while drastically reducing
computational requirements in terms of both parameters and floating-point
operations per second, compared to traditional CNNs and Vision Transformers.
Since the model focuses on biologically relevant regions, it also offers
improved explainability. The adaptive and lightweight nature of SparseAttnNet
makes it ideal for deployment in resource-constrained and high-throughput
settings, including imaging flow cytometry.

Abstract: Accurate multi-modal medical image translation requires ha-rmonizing global
anatomical semantics and local structural fidelity, a challenge complicated by
intermodality information loss and structural distortion. We propose ABS-Mamba,
a novel architecture integrating the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for
organ-aware semantic representation, specialized convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) for preserving modality-specific edge and texture details, and Mamba's
selective state-space modeling for efficient long- and short-range feature
dependencies. Structurally, our dual-resolution framework leverages SAM2's
image encoder to capture organ-scale semantics from high-resolution inputs,
while a parallel CNNs branch extracts fine-grained local features. The Robust
Feature Fusion Network (RFFN) integrates these epresentations, and the
Bidirectional Mamba Residual Network (BMRN) models spatial dependencies using
spiral scanning and bidirectional state-space dynamics. A three-stage skip
fusion decoder enhances edge and texture fidelity. We employ Efficient Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA+) fine-tuning to enable precise domain specialization while
maintaining the foundational capabilities of the pre-trained components.
Extensive experimental validation on the SynthRAD2023 and BraTS2019 datasets
demonstrates that ABS-Mamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering
high-fidelity cross-modal synthesis that preserves anatomical semantics and

Abstract: Background and Objective. Research in the cross-modal medical image
translation domain has been very productive over the past few years in tackling
the scarce availability of large curated multimodality datasets with the
promising performance of GAN-based architectures. However, only a few of these
studies assessed task-based related performance of these synthetic data,
especially for the training of deep models. Method. We design and compare
different GAN-based frameworks for generating synthetic brain
[18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET images from T1 weighted MRI data. We first
perform standard qualitative and quantitative visual quality evaluation. Then,
we explore further impact of using these fake PET data in the training of a
deep unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) model designed to detect subtle
epilepsy lesions in T1 MRI and FDG PET images. We introduce novel diagnostic
task-oriented quality metrics of the synthetic FDG PET data tailored to our
unsupervised detection task, then use these fake data to train a use case UAD
model combining a deep representation learning based on siamese autoencoders
with a OC-SVM density support estimation model. This model is trained on normal
subjects only and allows the detection of any variation from the pattern of the
normal population. We compare the detection performance of models trained on 35
paired real MR T1 of normal subjects paired either on 35 true PET images or on
35 synthetic PET images generated from the best performing generative models.
Performance analysis is conducted on 17 exams of epilepsy patients undergoing
surgery. Results. The best performing GAN-based models allow generating
realistic fake PET images of control subject with SSIM and PSNR values around
0.9 and 23.8, respectively and in distribution (ID) with regard to the true
control dataset. The best UAD model trained on these synthetic normative PET
data allows reaching 74% sensitivity. Conclusion. Our results confirm that
GAN-based models are the best suited for MR T1 to FDG PET translation,
outperforming transformer or diffusion models. We also demonstrate the
diagnostic value of these synthetic data for the training of UAD models and
evaluation on clinical exams of epilepsy patients. Our code and the normative
image dataset are available.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms are widely used in artificial intelligence to enhance
performance and interpretability. In this paper, we investigate their utility
in modeling classical dynamical systems -- specifically, a noisy predator-prey
(Lotka-Volterra) system. We train a simple linear attention model on perturbed
time-series data to reconstruct system trajectories. Remarkably, the learned
attention weights align with the geometric structure of the Lyapunov function:
high attention corresponds to flat regions (where perturbations have small
effect), and low attention aligns with steep regions (where perturbations have
large effect). We further demonstrate that attention-based weighting can serve
as a proxy for sensitivity analysis, capturing key phase-space properties
without explicit knowledge of the system equations. These results suggest a
novel use of AI-derived attention for interpretable, data-driven analysis and
control of nonlinear systems. For example our framework could support future
work in biological modeling of circadian rhythms, and interpretable machine
learning for dynamical environments.

<details>

Motivation: 研究神经DDEs的记忆容量如何影响其通用逼近性质，填补了连续时间神经网络理论中的空白。

Method: 通过分析神经DDEs的关键参数Kτ（Lipschitz常数与延迟的乘积），研究其动态行为与通用逼近性质的关系。

Result: 记忆容量Kτ较小时，神经DDEs可近似为神经ODEs，不具备通用逼近性质；Kτ较大时，神经DDEs具备通用逼近性质。

Conclusion: 记忆容量Kτ的大小是神经DDEs是否具备通用逼近性质的关键因素，且扩充架构可扩大通用逼近的参数范围。

Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), which are the
continuous-time analog of Residual Neural Networks (ResNets), have gained
significant attention in recent years. Similarly, Neural Delay Differential
Equations (Neural DDEs) can be interpreted as an infinite depth limit of
Densely Connected Residual Neural Networks (DenseResNets). In contrast to
traditional ResNet architectures, DenseResNets are feed-forward networks that
allow for shortcut connections across all layers. These additional connections
introduce memory in the network architecture, as typical in many modern
architectures. In this work, we explore how the memory capacity in neural DDEs
influences the universal approximation property. The key parameter for studying
the memory capacity is the product $K \tau$ of the Lipschitz constant and the
delay of the DDE. In the case of non-augmented architectures, where the network
width is not larger than the input and output dimensions, neural ODEs and
classical feed-forward neural networks cannot have the universal approximation
property. We show that if the memory capacity $K\tau$ is sufficiently small,
the dynamics of the neural DDE can be approximated by a neural ODE.
Consequently, non-augmented neural DDEs with a small memory capacity also lack
the universal approximation property. In contrast, if the memory capacity
$K\tau$ is sufficiently large, we can establish the universal approximation
property of neural DDEs for continuous functions. If the neural DDE
architecture is augmented, we can expand the parameter regions in which
universal approximation is possible. Overall, our results show that by
increasing the memory capacity $K\tau$, the infinite-dimensional phase space of
DDEs with positive delay $\tau>0$ is not sufficient to guarantee a direct jump
transition to universal approximation, but only after a certain memory
threshold, universal approximation holds.

Result: 异步FL（FedAsync）收敛速度提升10倍，但高端设备的更新频率和隐私损失分别高6-10倍和5倍，低端设备因更新少且噪声干扰导致精度下降。

Conclusion: 需要设计自适应的FL协议，根据设备能力和参与动态优化聚合与隐私机制，而非静态统一方案。

Abstract: Device heterogeneity poses major challenges in Federated Learning (FL), where
resource-constrained clients slow down synchronous schemes that wait for all
updates before aggregation. Asynchronous FL addresses this by incorporating
updates as they arrive, substantially improving efficiency. While its
efficiency gains are well recognized, its privacy costs remain largely
unexplored, particularly for high-end devices that contribute updates more
frequently, increasing their cumulative privacy exposure. This paper presents
the first comprehensive analysis of the efficiency-fairness-privacy trade-off
in synchronous vs. asynchronous FL under realistic device heterogeneity. We
empirically compare FedAvg and staleness-aware FedAsync using a physical
testbed of five edge devices spanning diverse hardware tiers, integrating Local
Differential Privacy (LDP) and the Moments Accountant to quantify per-client
privacy loss. Using Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) as a privacy-critical
benchmark, we show that FedAsync achieves up to 10x faster convergence but
exacerbates fairness and privacy disparities: high-end devices contribute 6-10x
more updates and incur up to 5x higher privacy loss, while low-end devices
suffer amplified accuracy degradation due to infrequent, stale, and
noise-perturbed updates. These findings motivate the need for adaptive FL
protocols that jointly optimize aggregation and privacy mechanisms based on
client capacity and participation dynamics, moving beyond static,
one-size-fits-all solutions.

TLDR: 研究发现，在某些条件下，CPU在移动设备上的LLM推理性能可以超过GPU，挑战了GPU优先的传统观念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战GPU在移动设备上LLM推理性能最优的假设，探索CPU的潜力。

Method: 在iPhone 15 Pro上部署1B参数的LLM，比较CPU和GPU配置的性能。

Result: CPU配置（双线程，F16精度）达到17 tokens/s，优于GPU的12.8 tokens/s。

Conclusion: CPU优化在移动AI中有潜力，但低层分析工具限制了对结果的完全解释。

Abstract: The common assumption in on-device AI is that GPUs, with their superior
parallel processing, always provide the best performance for large language
model (LLM) inference. In this work, we challenge this notion by empirically
demonstrating that, under certain conditions, CPUs can outperform GPUs for LLM
inference on mobile devices. Using a 1-billion-parameter LLM deployed via
llama.cpp on the iPhone 15 Pro, we show that a CPU-only configuration (two
threads, F16 precision) achieves 17 tokens per second, surpassing the 12.8
tokens per second obtained with GPU acceleration. We analyze the architectural
factors driving this counterintuitive result, revealing that GPU memory
transfer overhead and CPU thread optimization play a critical role.
Furthermore, we explore the impact of thread oversubscription, quantization
strategies, and hardware constraints, providing new insights into efficient
on-device AI execution. Our findings challenge conventional GPU-first thinking,
highlighting the untapped potential of optimized CPU inference and paving the
way for smarter deployment strategies in mobile AI. However, fully explaining
the observed CPU advantage remains difficult due to limited access to low-level
profiling tools on iOS.

Abstract: Edge computing has emerged as a pivotal technology, offering significant
advantages such as low latency, enhanced data security, and reduced reliance on
centralized cloud infrastructure. These benefits are crucial for applications
requiring real-time data processing or strict security measures. Despite these
advantages, edge devices operating within edge clusters are often
underutilized. This inefficiency is mainly due to the absence of a holistic
performance profiling mechanism which can help dynamically adjust the desired
system configuration for a given workload. Since edge computing environments
involve a complex interplay between CPU frequency, power consumption, and
application performance, a deeper understanding of these correlations is
essential. By uncovering these relationships, it becomes possible to make
informed decisions that enhance both computational efficiency and energy
savings. To address this gap, this paper evaluates the power consumption and
performance characteristics of a single processing node within an edge cluster
using a synthetic microbenchmark by varying the workload size and CPU
frequency. The results show how an optimal measure can lead to optimized usage
of edge resources, given both performance and power consumption.

Main category: cs.HC

TLDR: 研究发现，尽管区块链技术承诺去中心化，但用户在实际使用中仍依赖中心化的信任锚点（如交易所、社区领袖等），这与区块链的“无需信任”理念相矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨区块链技术在实际应用中是否真正实现了去中心化和信任自由，以及用户行为如何影响这一目标。

Method: 采用混合方法研究，包括对13位区块链利益相关者的半结构化访谈和Reddit上3000多条加密货币讨论的分析。

Result: 用户倾向于依赖中心化的信任锚点，尤其是新手和非技术用户，这与区块链的去中心化理念相矛盾。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了区块链理论上的去中心化与实际应用中的中心化信任之间的张力，强调了信任在“无需信任”环境中的持续作用。

Abstract: Blockchain technology promises to democratize finance and promote social
equity through decentralization, but questions remain about whether current
implementations advance or hinder these goals. Through a mixed-methods study
combining semi-structured interviews with 13 diverse blockchain stakeholders
and analysis of over 3,000 cryptocurrency discussions on Reddit, we examine how
trust manifests in cryptocurrency ecosystems despite their decentralized
architecture. Our findings uncover that users actively seek out and create
centralized trust anchors, such as established exchanges, prominent community
figures, and recognized development teams, contradicting blockchain's
fundamental promise of trustless interactions. We identify how this
contradiction arises from users' mental need for accountability and their
reluctance to shoulder the full responsibility of self-custody. The study also
reveals how these centralized trust patterns disproportionately impact
different user groups, with newer and less technical users showing stronger
preferences for centralized intermediaries. This work contributes to our
understanding of the inherent tensions between theoretical decentralization and
practical implementation in cryptocurrency systems, highlighting the persistent
role of centralized trust in supposedly trustless environments.

Motivation: 当前解释机制主要服务于AI研究人员和工程师，未能满足终端用户（如乘客）对自动驾驶决策的疑问，影响其使用和接受度。

Method: 通过两项用户研究：初步研究识别用户问题，第二项研究评估交互式文本解释对用户理解的影响。

Result: 交互式文本解释显著提升用户对自动驾驶决策的理解。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计激励用户参与和询问AI决策背后逻辑的交互提供了依据。

Abstract: Improving end-users' understanding of decisions made by autonomous vehicles
(AVs) driven by artificial intelligence (AI) can improve utilization and
acceptance of AVs. However, current explanation mechanisms primarily help AI
researchers and engineers in debugging and monitoring their AI systems, and may
not address the specific questions of end-users, such as passengers, about AVs
in various scenarios. In this paper, we conducted two user studies to
investigate questions that potential AV passengers might pose while riding in
an AV and evaluate how well answers to those questions improve their
understanding of AI-driven AV decisions. Our initial formative study identified
a range of questions about AI in autonomous driving that existing explanation
mechanisms do not readily address. Our second study demonstrated that
interactive text-based explanations effectively improved participants'
comprehension of AV decisions compared to simply observing AV decisions. These
findings inform the design of interactions that motivate end-users to engage
with and inquire about the reasoning behind AI-driven AV decisions.

Abstract: There is a growing demand for the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
Machine Learning (ML) in healthcare, particularly as clinical decision support
systems to assist medical professionals. However, the complexity of many of
these models, often referred to as black box models, raises concerns about
their safe integration into clinical settings as it is difficult to understand
how they arrived at their predictions. This paper discusses insights and
recommendations derived from an expert working group convened by the UK
Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The group consisted
of healthcare professionals, regulators, and data scientists, with a primary
focus on evaluating the outputs from different AI algorithms in clinical
decision-making contexts. Additionally, the group evaluated findings from a
pilot study investigating clinicians' behaviour and interaction with AI methods
during clinical diagnosis. Incorporating AI methods is crucial for ensuring the
safety and trustworthiness of medical AI devices in clinical settings. Adequate
training for stakeholders is essential to address potential issues, and further
insights and recommendations for safely adopting AI systems in healthcare

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工智能和深度学习技术的发展，基于视觉的交互逐渐取代传统输入设备，成为智能系统与用户交互的重要方式。

Method: 结合卡尔曼滤波和深度学习特征提取方法，DeepSORT算法在动态环境中实现精准目标跟踪，适用于多目标跟踪和快速运动的复杂场景。

Result: 实验证明，DeepSORT在手势识别与跟踪中表现优异，能准确捕捉用户手势轨迹，实时性和准确性优于传统方法，并能稳定处理目标遮挡和运动模糊。

Conclusion: 未来研究方向包括算法优化、数据融合和多模态交互，以推动更智能化和个性化的交互体验。

Abstract: Based on the DeepSORT algorithm, this study explores the application of
visual tracking technology in intelligent human-computer interaction,
especially in the field of gesture recognition and tracking. With the rapid
development of artificial intelligence and deep learning technology,
visual-based interaction has gradually replaced traditional input devices and
become an important way for intelligent systems to interact with users. The
DeepSORT algorithm can achieve accurate target tracking in dynamic environments
by combining Kalman filters and deep learning feature extraction methods. It is
especially suitable for complex scenes with multi-target tracking and fast
movements. This study experimentally verifies the superior performance of
DeepSORT in gesture recognition and tracking. It can accurately capture and
track the user's gesture trajectory and is superior to traditional tracking
methods in terms of real-time and accuracy. In addition, this study also
combines gesture recognition experiments to evaluate the recognition ability
and feedback response of the DeepSORT algorithm under different gestures (such
as sliding, clicking, and zooming). The experimental results show that DeepSORT
can not only effectively deal with target occlusion and motion blur but also
can stably track in a multi-target environment, achieving a smooth user
interaction experience. Finally, this paper looks forward to the future
development direction of intelligent human-computer interaction systems based
on visual tracking and proposes future research focuses such as algorithm
optimization, data fusion, and multimodal interaction in order to promote a
more intelligent and personalized interactive experience. Keywords-DeepSORT,

TLDR: R-CAGE是一个理论框架，旨在通过结构化干预重构长期人机交互中的情感输出，强调心理恢复和用户自主性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感计算方法忽视了重复情感互动的认知和结构后果，R-CAGE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: R-CAGE包含四个控制模块：节奏表达控制、感官结构调整、认知框架保护和自我对齐响应设计。

Result: 框架通过调节情感节奏、感官强度和解释空间，减少用户疲劳和认知过载。

Conclusion: R-CAGE将情感视为可持续设计单元，保护用户在AI环境中的长期解释自主性。

Abstract: This paper presents R-CAGE (Rhythmic Control Architecture for Guarding Ego),
a theoretical framework for restructuring emotional output in long-term
human-AI interaction. While prior affective computing approaches emphasized
expressiveness, immersion, and responsiveness, they often neglected the
cognitive and structural consequences of repeated emotional engagement. R-CAGE
instead conceptualizes emotional output not as reactive expression but as
ethical design structure requiring architectural intervention. The model is
grounded in experiential observations of subtle affective symptoms such as
localized head tension, interpretive fixation, and emotional lag arising from
prolonged interaction with affective AI systems. These indicate a mismatch
between system-driven emotion and user interpretation that cannot be fully
explained by biometric data or observable behavior. R-CAGE adopts a
user-centered stance prioritizing psychological recovery, interpretive
autonomy, and identity continuity. The framework consists of four control
blocks: (1) Control of Rhythmic Expression regulates output pacing to reduce
fatigue; (2) Architecture of Sensory Structuring adjusts intensity and timing
of affective stimuli; (3) Guarding of Cognitive Framing reduces semantic
pressure to allow flexible interpretation; (4) Ego-Aligned Response Design
supports self-reference recovery during interpretive lag. By structurally
regulating emotional rhythm, sensory intensity, and interpretive affordances,
R-CAGE frames emotion not as performative output but as sustainable design
unit. The goal is to protect users from oversaturation and cognitive overload
while sustaining long-term interpretive agency in AI-mediated environments.

Motivation: 手动分割医学图像耗时且易出错，而全自动算法需要用户反馈，因此结合AI和VR技术提供更高效的解决方案。

Method: 利用AI基础模型和VR交互，通过语音交互和点提示生成分割掩码，并比较VR控制器、头部指向和眼动追踪三种输入模式。

Result: 用户研究表明系统具有高可用性（SUS=90.0±9.0）、低任务负载，并支持AI在放射学分割任务中的应用。

Conclusion: SAMIRA展示了AI与VR结合在医学图像分割中的潜力，提升了用户体验和任务效率。

Abstract: Crucial in disease analysis and surgical planning, manual segmentation of
volumetric medical scans (e.g. MRI, CT) is laborious, error-prone, and
challenging to master, while fully automatic algorithms can benefit from
user-feedback. Therefore, with the complementary power of the latest
radiological AI foundation models and virtual reality (VR)'s intuitive data
interaction, we propose SAMIRA, a novel conversational AI agent that assists
users with localizing, segmenting, and visualizing 3D medical concepts in VR.
Through speech-based interaction, the agent helps users understand radiological
features, locate clinical targets, and generate segmentation masks that can be
refined with just a few point prompts. The system also supports true-to-scale
3D visualization of segmented pathology to enhance patient-specific anatomical
understanding. Furthermore, to determine the optimal interaction paradigm under
near-far attention-switching for refining segmentation masks in an immersive,
human-in-the-loop workflow, we compare VR controller pointing, head pointing,
and eye tracking as input modes. With a user study, evaluations demonstrated a
high usability score (SUS=90.0 $\pm$ 9.0), low overall task load, as well as
strong support for the proposed VR system's guidance, training potential, and
integration of AI in radiological segmentation tasks.

Motivation: 现有嵌入可视化工具存在采用障碍（如数据加载繁琐、可扩展性限制）和分析限制（缺乏外部工具集成），需要一种更高效的工具。

Method: Embedding Atlas利用现代Web技术和高级算法（如基于密度的聚类和自动标注），提供快速、丰富的分析体验。

Result: 通过与其他工具的竞争分析，Embedding Atlas显著减少了使用摩擦，并在百万级数据点上展示了实时渲染性能。

Conclusion: Embedding Atlas作为开源工具，为未来嵌入分析提供了高效支持。

Abstract: Embedding projections are popular for visualizing large datasets and models.
However, people often encounter "friction" when using embedding visualization
tools: (1) barriers to adoption, e.g., tedious data wrangling and loading,
scalability limits, no integration of results into existing workflows, and (2)
limitations in possible analyses, without integration with external tools to
additionally show coordinated views of metadata. In this paper, we present
Embedding Atlas, a scalable, interactive visualization tool designed to make
interacting with large embeddings as easy as possible. Embedding Atlas uses
modern web technologies and advanced algorithms -- including density-based
clustering, and automated labeling -- to provide a fast and rich data analysis
experience at scale. We evaluate Embedding Atlas with a competitive analysis
against other popular embedding tools, showing that Embedding Atlas's feature
set specifically helps reduce friction, and report a benchmark on its real-time
rendering performance with millions of points. Embedding Atlas is available as
open source to support future work in embedding-based analysis.

Conclusion: 代理驱动的可视化范式有望改变用户与可视化工具的交互方式，推动相关研究和产业发展。

Abstract: While powerful and well-established, tools like ParaView present a steep
learning curve that discourages many potential users. This work introduces
ParaView-MCP, an autonomous agent that integrates modern multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) with ParaView to not only lower the barrier to entry
but also augment ParaView with intelligent decision support. By leveraging the
state-of-the-art reasoning, command execution, and vision capabilities of
MLLMs, ParaView-MCP enables users to interact with ParaView through natural
language and visual inputs. Specifically, our system adopted the Model Context
Protocol (MCP) - a standardized interface for model-application communication -
that facilitates direct interaction between MLLMs with ParaView's Python API to
allow seamless information exchange between the user, the language model, and
the visualization tool itself. Furthermore, by implementing a visual feedback
mechanism that allows the agent to observe the viewport, we unlock a range of
new capabilities, including recreating visualizations from examples,
closed-loop visualization parameter updates based on user-defined goals, and
even cross-application collaboration involving multiple tools. Broadly, we
believe such an agent-driven visualization paradigm can profoundly change the
way we interact with visualization tools. We expect a significant uptake in the
development of such visualization tools, in both visualization research and
industry.

Abstract: Transforming educational technologies through the integration of large
language models (LLMs) and virtual reality (VR) offers the potential for
immersive and interactive learning experiences. However, the effects of LLMs on
user engagement and attention in educational environments remain open
questions. In this study, we utilized a fully LLM-driven virtual learning
environment, where peers and teachers were LLM-driven, to examine how students
behaved in such settings. Specifically, we investigate how peer question-asking
behaviors influenced student engagement, attention, cognitive load, and
learning outcomes and found that, in conditions where LLM-driven peer learners
asked questions, students exhibited more targeted visual scanpaths, with their
attention directed toward the learning content, particularly in complex
subjects. Our results suggest that peer questions did not introduce extraneous
cognitive load directly, as the cognitive load is strongly correlated with
increased attention to the learning material. Considering these findings, we
provide design recommendations for optimizing VR learning spaces.

Abstract: Visual Analytics (VA) integrates humans, data, and models as key actors in
insight generation and data-driven decision-making. This position paper values

observations that motivate a fresh perspective on VA. The contribution is the
HDMI Canvas, a perspective to VA that complements the strengths of existing VA
process models and frameworks. It systematically characterizes diverse roles of
humans, data, and models, and how these actors benefit from and contribute to
VA processes. The descriptive power of the HDMI Canvas eases the
differentiation between a series of VA building blocks, rather than describing
general VA principles only. The canvas includes modern human-centered
methodologies, including human knowledge externalization and forms of feedback
loops, while interpretable and explainable AI highlight model contributions
beyond their conventional outputs. The HDMI Canvas has generative power,
guiding the design of new VA processes and is optimized for external
stakeholders, improving VA outreach, interdisciplinary collaboration, and
user-centered design. The utility of the HDMI Canvas is demonstrated through
two preliminary case studies.

Motivation: MPNN模型在原子模拟中表现出高精度，但其并行化在大规模模拟中存在困难，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 通过最小化每层MPNN中局部原子间的数据通信，避免冗余计算，实现线性扩展。结合递归嵌入原子神经网络模型，验证了算法的强扩展性和弱扩展性。

Result: 该算法在多个基准系统中表现出色，支持数亿原子的快速分子动力学模拟，扩展了MPNN模型的适用规模。

Conclusion: 该并行化框架为MPNN模型提供了高效模拟大规模复杂系统的能力。

Abstract: Machine learning potentials have achieved great success in accelerating
atomistic simulations. Many of them rely on local descriptors that readily
allow parallelization. More recent message passing neural network (MPNN) models
have demonstrated their superior accuracy and become increasingly popular.
However, parallelizing MPNN models for large-scale simulations across compute
nodes remains a challenge, as the previously argued poor scalability with the
number of MP layers and the necessity of data communication. Here, we propose
an efficient parallel algorithm for MPNN models, in which additional data
communication is minimized among local atoms only in each MP layer without
redundant computation, thus scaling linearly with the layer number. Integrated
with our recursively embedded atom neural network model, this algorithm
demonstrates excellent strong scaling and weak scaling behaviors in several
benchmark systems. This approach enables massive molecular dynamics simulations
on MPNN models for hundreds of millions of atoms as fast as on strictly local
models, vastly extending the applicability of the MPNN potential to an
unprecedented scale. This general parallelization framework can empower various
MPNN models to efficiently simulate very large and complex systems.

Result: 模型在AudioSet Strong基准测试中表现出比仅使用全局标注的模型更好的时间对齐能力。

Conclusion: 时间对齐的文本描述能有效提升音频-文本模型的性能，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Learning to associate audio with textual descriptions is valuable for a range
of tasks, including pretraining, zero-shot classification, audio retrieval,
audio captioning, and text-conditioned audio generation. Existing contrastive
language-audio pretrained models are typically trained using global, clip-level
descriptions, which provide only weak temporal supervision. We hypothesize that
CLAP-like language-audio models - particularly, if they are expected to produce
frame-level embeddings - can benefit from a stronger temporal supervision. To
confirm our hypothesis, we curate a novel dataset of approximately 12,000 audio
recordings from Freesound, each annotated with single-sentence free-text
descriptions linked to a specific temporal segment in an audio recording. We
use large language models to clean these annotations by removing references to
non-audible events, transcribed speech, typos, and annotator language bias. We
further propose a frame-wise contrastive training strategy that learns to align
text descriptions with temporal regions in an audio recording and demonstrate
that our model has better temporal text-audio alignment abilities compared to
models trained only on global captions when evaluated on the AudioSet Strong
benchmark. The dataset and our source code are available on Zenodo and GitHub,
respectively.

Result: 验证了认证功能的可靠性，解决了现有实现中的漏洞。

Conclusion: 通过形式化验证，作者提供了一个可靠的认证功能，增强了全局鲁棒神经网络的可信度。

Abstract: Neural networks are often susceptible to minor perturbations in input that
cause them to misclassify. A recent solution to this problem is the use of
globally-robust neural networks, which employ a function to certify that the
classification of an input cannot be altered by such a perturbation. Outputs
that pass this test are called certified robust. However, to the authors'
knowledge, these certification functions have not yet been verified at the
implementation level. We demonstrate how previous unverified implementations
are exploitably unsound in certain circumstances. Moreover, they often rely on
approximation-based algorithms, such as power iteration, that (perhaps
surprisingly) do not guarantee soundness. To provide assurance that a given
output is robust, we implemented and formally verified a certification function
for globally-robust neural networks in Dafny. We describe the program, its
specifications, and the important design decisions taken for its implementation
and verification, as well as our experience applying it in practice.

### [525] [Direct Data Driven Control Using Noisy Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06407)
*Ramin Esmzad,Gokul S. Sankar,Teawon Han,Hamidreza Modares*

Main category: eess.SY

TLDR: 提出了一种直接数据驱动的控制框架，用于在干扰和噪声状态下解决LQR问题，无需系统辨识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在系统动态未知且存在噪声的情况下，设计一种无需系统辨识的直接数据驱动控制方法。

Method: 利用凸优化技术，将噪声统计直接纳入控制器合成，通过LMI和SDP确保稳定性和最优性能。

Result: 仿真实验表明，该方法在鲁棒性和准确性上优于现有数据驱动LQR方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为噪声环境中的控制器设计提供了实用且理论可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel direct data-driven control framework for solving
the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) under disturbances and noisy state
measurements. The system dynamics are assumed unknown, and the LQR solution is
learned using only a single trajectory of noisy input-output data while
bypassing system identification. Our approach guarantees mean-square stability
(MSS) and optimal performance by leveraging convex optimization techniques that
incorporate noise statistics directly into the controller synthesis. First, we
establish a theoretical result showing that the MSS of an uncertain data-driven
system implies the MSS of the true closed-loop system. Building on this, we
develop a robust stability condition using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs)
that yields a stabilizing controller gain from noisy measurements. Finally, we
formulate a data-driven LQR problem as a semidefinite program (SDP) that
computes an optimal gain, minimizing the steady-state covariance. Extensive
simulations on benchmark systems -- including a rotary inverted pendulum and an
active suspension system -- demonstrate the superior robustness and accuracy of
our method compared to existing data-driven LQR approaches. The proposed
framework offers a practical and theoretically grounded solution for controller
design in noise-corrupted environments where system identification is
infeasible.

TLDR: YANNs是一种完全可解释的神经网络架构，无需训练即可高效表示分段仿射函数，并在多参数模型预测控制中保持理论最优性和控制理论保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络通常用于近似最优控制律，而无法精确表示它们，YANNs旨在填补这一空白，提供一种高效且可解释的解决方案。

Method: YANNs通过多参数模型预测控制展示其能力，直接计算分段仿射函数，保留递归可行性和稳定性等控制理论特性。

Result: YANNs在实时评估中速度显著快于传统分段仿射函数计算，并通过数值案例展示了其算法可扩展性。

Conclusion: YANNs是首个基于神经网络的控制器，能确保可行性和稳定性，为数据驱动的建模/控制提供了高效且可解释的起点。

Abstract: This work formally introduces Y-wise Affine Neural Networks (YANNs), a
fully-explainable network architecture that continuously and efficiently
represent piecewise affine functions with polytopic subdomains. Following from
the proofs, it is shown that the development of YANNs requires no training to
achieve the functionally equivalent representation. YANNs thus maintain all
mathematical properties of the original formulations. Multi-parametric model
predictive control is utilized as an application showcase of YANNs, which
theoretically computes optimal control laws as a piecewise affine function of
states, outputs, setpoints, and disturbances. With the exact representation of
multi-parametric control laws, YANNs retain essential control-theoretic
guarantees such as recursive feasibility and stability. This sets YANNs apart
from the existing works which apply neural networks for approximating optimal
control laws instead of exactly representing them. By optimizing the inference
speed of the networks, YANNs can evaluate substantially faster in real-time
compared to traditional piecewise affine function calculations. Numerical case
studies are presented to demonstrate the algorithmic scalability with respect
to the input/output dimensions and the number of subdomains. YANNs represent a
significant advancement in control as the first neural network-based controller
that inherently ensures both feasibility and stability. Future applications can
leverage them as an efficient and interpretable starting point for data-driven
modeling/control.

Motivation: 现有GP-MPC方法要么依赖近似而缺乏保证，要么过于保守，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出采样框架，高效传播模型认知不确定性，避免保守性；建立样本复杂度结果，构建可达集；设计采样GP-MPC方案。

Result: 证明了递归可行性和闭环安全稳定性；数值实验展示了准确的可达集过近似和安全的闭环性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在保证安全性和稳定性的同时，避免了保守性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) regression is shown to be effective for learning
unknown dynamics, enabling efficient and safety-aware control strategies across
diverse applications. However, existing GP-based model predictive control
(GP-MPC) methods either rely on approximations, thus lacking guarantees, or are
overly conservative, which limits their practical utility. To close this gap,
we present a sampling-based framework that efficiently propagates the model's
epistemic uncertainty while avoiding conservatism. We establish a novel sample
complexity result that enables the construction of a reachable set using a
finite number of dynamics functions sampled from the GP posterior. Building on
this, we design a sampling-based GP-MPC scheme that is recursively feasible and
guarantees closed-loop safety and stability with high probability. Finally, we
showcase the effectiveness of our method on two numerical examples,
highlighting accurate reachable set over-approximation and safe closed-loop
performance.

Motivation: 工业自动化需要兼顾性能与环境及成本约束的能量高效控制策略。

Method: 设计了复合奖励函数，同时惩罚跟踪误差和电力消耗，并通过实验探索能量惩罚权重alpha的影响。

Result: 实验显示alpha值在0.0到0.25之间时性能显著变化，低alpha值下出现非帕累托最优解。

Conclusion: 未来工作将自动化alpha选择，并推进从仿真到实际部署的过渡。

Abstract: Industrial automation increasingly demands energy-efficient control
strategies to balance performance with environmental and cost constraints. In
this work, we present a multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) framework
for energy-efficient control of the Quanser Aero 2 testbed in its
one-degree-of-freedom configuration. We design a composite reward function that
simultaneously penalizes tracking error and electrical power consumption.
Preliminary experiments explore the influence of varying the Energy penalty
weight, alpha, on the trade-off between pitch tracking and energy savings. Our
results reveal a marked performance shift for alpha values between 0.0 and
0.25, with non-Pareto optimal solutions emerging at lower alpha values, on both
the simulation and the real system. We hypothesize that these effects may be
attributed to artifacts introduced by the adaptive behavior of the Adam
optimizer, which could bias the learning process and favor bang-bang control
strategies. Future work will focus on automating alpha selection through
Gaussian Process-based Pareto front modeling and transitioning the approach
from simulation to real-world deployment.

TLDR: 研究探讨了轻度认知障碍（MCI）患者中谵妄的风险因素，通过机器学习模型预测谵妄风险，并分析了MCI患者的生存概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 谵妄在MCI患者中具有高发病率和死亡率，需识别风险因素以改善临床管理。

Method: 利用MIMIC-IV v2.2数据库进行回顾性分析，结合LSTM模型预测谵妄风险。

Result: 模型表现优异（AUROC 0.93，AUPRC 0.92），MCI患者谵妄后生存概率显著降低。

Conclusion: 研究强调合并症对谵妄风险的重要性，并验证了时间序列预测模型的有效性。

Abstract: Delirium represents a significant clinical concern characterized by high
morbidity and mortality rates, particularly in patients with mild cognitive
impairment (MCI). This study investigates the associated risk factors for
delirium by analyzing the comorbidity patterns relevant to MCI and developing a
longitudinal predictive model leveraging machine learning methodologies. A
retrospective analysis utilizing the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database was performed to
evaluate comorbid conditions, survival probabilities, and predictive modeling
outcomes. The examination of comorbidity patterns identified distinct risk
profiles for the MCI population. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated
that individuals with MCI exhibit markedly reduced survival probabilities when
developing delirium compared to their non-MCI counterparts, underscoring the
heightened vulnerability within this cohort. For predictive modeling, a Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) ML network was implemented utilizing time-series data,
demographic variables, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) scores, and an array of
comorbid conditions. The model demonstrated robust predictive capabilities with
an AUROC of 0.93 and an AUPRC of 0.92. This study underscores the critical role
of comorbidities in evaluating delirium risk and highlights the efficacy of
time-series predictive modeling in pinpointing patients at elevated risk for
delirium development.

*Geraldine Henningsen*

Main category: stat.AP

TLDR: 本文提出了一种新的难民和寻求庇护者流动监测方法，结合冲突预测与经济、政治和人口变量，通过梯度提升分类评估两种风险：显著流动和流动突然增加的可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预测模型能高精度预测冲突，但难以转化为具体的难民流动预测，因为触发大规模流动的具体事件不明确。

Method: 使用梯度提升分类，结合冲突预测与经济、政治和人口变量，生成月度风险指数，预测未来1、3、6个月的流动风险。

Result: 模型在预测显著流动时准确性高，预测流动突然增加时表现良好，后者因触发因素复杂而更具挑战性。

Conclusion: 该风险指数为人道主义规划提供量化支持，但需作为更广泛分析框架中的决策辅助工具。

Abstract: Monitoring tools for anticipatory action are increasingly gaining traction to
improve the efficiency and timeliness of humanitarian responses. Whilst
predictive models can now forecast conflicts with high accuracy, translating
these predictions into potential forced displacement movements remains
challenging because it is often unclear which precise events will trigger
significant population movements. This paper presents a novel monitoring
approach for refugee and asylum seeker flows that addresses this challenge.
Using gradient boosting classification, we combine conflict forecasts with a
comprehensive set of economic, political, and demographic variables to assess
two distinct risks at the country of origin: the likelihood of significant
displacement flows and the probability of sudden increases in these flows. The
model generates country-specific monthly risk indices for these two events with
prediction horizons of one, three, and six months. Our analysis shows high
accuracy in predicting significant displacement flows and good accuracy in
forecasting sudden increases in displacement--the latter being inherently more
difficult to predict, given the complexity of displacement triggers. We achieve
these results by including predictive factors beyond conflict, thereby
demonstrating that forced displacement risks can be assessed through an
integrated analysis of multiple country-level indicators. Whilst these risk
indices provide valuable quantitative support for humanitarian planning, they
should always be understood as decision-support tools within a broader
analytical framework.

Motivation: 风电功率的波动性对电网稳定运行构成挑战，准确预测是实现可再生能源并网的关键需求。

Result: 在100多个英国风电场的数据验证中，该方法在CRPS和可靠性方面优于基准方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效处理不确定性，为电网集成和决策提供稳健的概率预测。

Abstract: Wind power plays an increasingly significant role in achieving the 2050 Net
Zero Strategy. Despite its rapid growth, its inherent variability presents
challenges in forecasting. Accurately forecasting wind power generation is one
key demand for the stable and controllable integration of renewable energy into
existing grid operations. This paper proposes an adaptive method for very
short-term forecasting that combines the generalised logit transformation with
a Bayesian approach. The generalised logit transformation processes
double-bounded wind power data to an unbounded domain, facilitating the
application of Bayesian methods. A novel adaptive mechanism for updating the
transformation shape parameter is introduced to leverage Bayesian updates by
recovering a small sample of representative data. Four adaptive forecasting
methods are investigated, evaluating their advantages and limitations through
an extensive case study of over 100 wind farms ranging four years in the UK.
The methods are evaluated using the Continuous Ranked Probability Score and we
propose the use of functional reliability diagrams to assess calibration.
Results indicate that the proposed Bayesian method with adaptive shape
parameter updating outperforms benchmarks, yielding consistent improvements in
CRPS and forecast reliability. The method effectively addresses uncertainty,
ensuring robust and accurate probabilistic forecasting which is essential for
grid integration and decision-making.

TLDR: 论文探讨了使用GPT模型结合检索增强生成（RAG）技术对北约情感、北约团结及北约第5条信任意见分数进行定性和定量分析。通过多层级RAG分析，发现相关意见分数呈下降趋势。


<details>

Motivation: 研究旨在探索基于AI的方法，为复杂分析提供支持，而非进行实际政治分析。

Method: 采用GPT-4.1模型和RAG技术，分两级分析新闻数据：首级生成定性摘要和定量分数，次级汇总摘要。使用贝叶斯回归分析趋势。

Result: 分析显示北约团结相关意见分数呈下降趋势，模型能提供有价值的定性和定量分析结果。

Conclusion: GPT模型可用于新闻分析，提供重要见解；动态模型能模拟公众意见演变。

Abstract: The paper considers the use of GPT models with retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) for qualitative and quantitative analytics on NATO sentiments, NATO unity
and NATO Article 5 trust opinion scores in different web sources: news sites
found via Google Search API, Youtube videos with comments, and Reddit
discussions. A RAG approach using GPT-4.1 model was applied to analyse news
where NATO related topics were discussed. Two levels of RAG analytics were
used: on the first level, the GPT model generates qualitative news summaries
and quantitative opinion scores using zero-shot prompts; on the second level,
the GPT model generates the summary of news summaries. Quantitative news
opinion scores generated by the GPT model were analysed using Bayesian
regression to get trend lines. The distributions found for the regression
parameters make it possible to analyse an uncertainty in specified news opinion
score trends. Obtained results show a downward trend for analysed scores of
opinion related to NATO unity.
  This approach does not aim to conduct real political analysis; rather, it
consider AI based approaches which can be used for further analytics
  as a part of a complex analytical approach. The obtained results demonstrate
that the use of GPT models for news analysis can give informative qualitative
and quantitative analytics, providing important insights.
  The dynamic model based on neural ordinary differential equations was
considered for modelling public opinions. This approach makes it possible to
analyse different scenarios for evolving public opinions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多样条件下难以通用，需要更高效的爬取新网页的算法。

Method: 利用LLM对网页进行分类，选择索引页作为爬取起点。

Result: LLM方法在分类性能和新页面覆盖率上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: LLM分类方法能有效提升网页爬取效率。

Abstract: A web crawler is a system designed to collect web pages, and efficient
crawling of new pages requires appropriate algorithms. While website features
such as XML sitemaps and the frequency of past page updates provide important
clues for accessing new pages, their universal application across diverse
conditions is challenging. In this study, we propose a method to efficiently
collect new pages by classifying web pages into two types, "Index Pages" and
"Content Pages," using a large language model (LLM), and leveraging the
classification results to select index pages as starting points for accessing
new pages. We construct a dataset with automatically annotated web page types
and evaluate our approach from two perspectives: the page type classification
performance and coverage of new pages. Experimental results demonstrate that
the LLM-based method outperformed baseline methods in both evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 系统性综述的布尔查询构建复杂，手动操作困难，研究探索LLM在此任务中的潜力，并解决先前研究中的不足。

Result: 查询效果因模型和提示设计差异显著，提示设计和模型选择是成功的关键。

Conclusion: LLM在布尔查询生成中具有潜力，但需模型和提示优化；系统性综述的复杂性凸显了可重复性研究的重要性。

Abstract: Systematic reviews are comprehensive literature reviews that address highly
focused research questions and represent the highest form of evidence in
medicine. A critical step in this process is the development of complex Boolean
queries to retrieve relevant literature. Given the difficulty of manually
constructing these queries, recent efforts have explored Large Language Models
(LLMs) to assist in their formulation. One of the first studies,Wang et al.,
investigated ChatGPT for this task, followed by Staudinger et al., which
evaluated multiple LLMs in a reproducibility study. However, the latter
overlooked several key aspects of the original work, including (i) validation
of generated queries, (ii) output formatting constraints, and (iii) selection
of examples for chain-of-thought (Guided) prompting. As a result, its findings
diverged significantly from the original study. In this work, we systematically
reproduce both studies while addressing these overlooked factors. Our results
show that query effectiveness varies significantly across models and prompt
designs, with guided query formulation benefiting from well-chosen seed
studies. Overall, prompt design and model selection are key drivers of
successful query formulation. Our findings provide a clearer understanding of
LLMs' potential in Boolean query generation and highlight the importance of
model- and prompt-specific optimisations. The complex nature of systematic
reviews adds to challenges in both developing and reproducing methods but also
highlights the importance of reproducibility studies in this domain.

Motivation: 探讨预训练和微调在密集检索器中的相对重要性，验证先前研究结论的普适性。

Method: 扩展分析，测试不同表示方法（CLS token vs. 平均池化）、架构（BERT vs. LLaMA）和数据集（MSMARCO和Natural Questions）。

Result: 预训练知识主导检索性能，微调主要调整神经元激活而非重组知识，但这一结论不适用于平均池化和LLaMA模型。

Conclusion: 预训练对密集检索器至关重要，但微调的作用因模型和任务而异，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Dense retrievers utilize pre-trained backbone language models (e.g., BERT,
LLaMA) that are fine-tuned via contrastive learning to perform the task of
encoding text into sense representations that can be then compared via a
shallow similarity operation, e.g. inner product. Recent research has
questioned the role of fine-tuning vs. that of pre-training within dense
retrievers, specifically arguing that retrieval knowledge is primarily gained
during pre-training, meaning knowledge not acquired during pre-training cannot
be sub-sequentially acquired via fine-tuning. We revisit this idea here as the
claim was only studied in the context of a BERT-based encoder using DPR as
representative dense retriever. We extend the previous analysis by testing
other representation approaches (comparing the use of CLS tokens with that of
mean pooling), backbone architectures (encoder-only BERT vs. decoder-only
LLaMA), and additional datasets (MSMARCO in addition to Natural Questions). Our
study confirms that in DPR tuning, pre-trained knowledge underpins retrieval
performance, with fine-tuning primarily adjusting neuron activation rather than
reorganizing knowledge. However, this pattern does not hold universally, such
as in mean-pooled (Contriever) and decoder-based (LLaMA) models. We ensure full
reproducibility and make our implementation publicly available at

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在文档任务中的应用增加，确保其输出的可信度和可解释性成为关键问题。

Method: 1. 零样本方法，将引用问题转化为文本蕴含任务；2. 利用注意力机制优化引用过程。

Result: 零样本方法在AttributionBench上分别提升0.27%和2.4%；注意力机制在多数层表现优于基线。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效提升大语言模型在文档任务中的引用可靠性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to document-based
tasks - such as document summarization, question answering, and information
extraction - where user requirements focus on retrieving information from
provided documents rather than relying on the model's parametric knowledge,
ensuring the trustworthiness and interpretability of these systems has become a
critical concern. A central approach to addressing this challenge is
attribution, which involves tracing the generated outputs back to their source
documents. However, since LLMs can produce inaccurate or imprecise responses,
it is crucial to assess the reliability of these citations.
  To tackle this, our work proposes two techniques. (1) A zero-shot approach
that frames attribution as a straightforward textual entailment task. Our
method using flan-ul2 demonstrates an improvement of 0.27% and 2.4% over the
best baseline of ID and OOD sets of AttributionBench, respectively. (2) We also
explore the role of the attention mechanism in enhancing the attribution
process. Using a smaller LLM, flan-t5-small, the F1 scores outperform the
baseline across almost all layers except layer 4 and layers 8 through 11.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于关键词的推荐系统限制了用户表达复杂偏好的能力，无法满足个性化需求。

Conclusion: 为下一代基于对话AI的搜索和推荐系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: As digital media platforms strive to meet evolving user expectations,
delivering highly personalized and intuitive movies and media recommendations
has become essential for attracting and retaining audiences. Traditional
systems often rely on keyword-based search and recommendation techniques, which
limit users to specific keywords and a combination of keywords. This paper
proposes an approach that generates synthetic datasets by modeling real-world
user interactions, creating complex chat-style data reflective of diverse
preferences. This allows users to express more information with complex
preferences, such as mood, plot details, and thematic elements, in addition to
conventional criteria like genre, title, and actor-based searches. In today's
search space, users cannot write queries like ``Looking for a fantasy movie
featuring dire wolves, ideally set in a harsh frozen world with themes of
loyalty and survival.''
  Building on these contributions, we evaluate synthetic datasets for diversity
and effectiveness in training and benchmarking models, particularly in areas
often absent from traditional datasets. This approach enhances personalization
and accuracy by enabling expressive and natural user queries. It establishes a
foundation for the next generation of conversational AI-driven search and
recommendation systems in digital entertainment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG框架通过外部知识提升LLM的准确性，但易受对抗性攻击，需一种方法保护检索质量。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks improve the accuracy of large
language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge from retrieved
documents, thereby overcoming the limitations of models' static intrinsic
knowledge. However, these systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks that
manipulate the retrieval process by introducing documents that are adversarial
yet semantically similar to the query. Notably, while these adversarial
documents resemble the query, they exhibit weak similarity to benign documents
in the retrieval set. Thus, we propose a simple yet effective Graph-based
Reranking against Adversarial Document Attacks (GRADA) framework aiming at
preserving retrieval quality while significantly reducing the success of
adversaries. Our study evaluates the effectiveness of our approach through
experiments conducted on five LLMs: GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4o, Llama3.1-8b,
Llama3.1-70b, and Qwen2.5-7b. We use three datasets to assess performance, with
results from the Natural Questions dataset demonstrating up to an 80% reduction
in attack success rates while maintaining minimal loss in accuracy.

TLDR: 提出了一种将高性能大语言模型（LLM）蒸馏为高效低延迟学生模型的新框架，以在电商搜索中平衡排名能力和实时性需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）在搜索任务中具有优越的排名能力，但难以满足实时系统的低延迟需求。

Method: 先训练LLM作为分类模型生成软目标，再训练学生模型通过均方误差损失学习产品对之间的相关性差异，并通过生成未标记数据扩展训练集。

Result: 学生模型性能随增强数据量增加而提升，甚至可超越教师模型，并已在Walmart.com成功部署。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了LLM在实时系统中的部署问题，同时提升了搜索相关性。

Abstract: Ensuring the products displayed in e-commerce search results are relevant to
users queries is crucial for improving the user experience. With their advanced
semantic understanding, deep learning models have been widely used for
relevance matching in search tasks. While large language models (LLMs) offer
superior ranking capabilities, it is challenging to deploy LLMs in real-time
systems due to the high-latency requirements. To leverage the ranking power of
LLMs while meeting the low-latency demands of production systems, we propose a
novel framework that distills a high performing LLM into a more efficient,
low-latency student model. To help the student model learn more effectively
from the teacher model, we first train the teacher LLM as a classification
model with soft targets. Then, we train the student model to capture the
relevance margin between pairs of products for a given query using mean squared
error loss. Instead of using the same training data as the teacher model, we
significantly expand the student model dataset by generating unlabeled data and
labeling it with the teacher model predictions. Experimental results show that
the student model performance continues to improve as the size of the augmented
training data increases. In fact, with enough augmented data, the student model
can outperform the teacher model. The student model has been successfully
deployed in production at Walmart.com with significantly positive metrics.

Abstract: Taking its point of departure in the recent developments in the field of
digital humanities and the increasing automatisation of scholarly workflows,
this study explores the implications of digital approaches to textual
traditions for the broader field of textual scholarship. It argues that the
relative simplicity of creating computergenerated stemmas allows us to view the
stemma codicum as a research tool rather than the final product of our
scholarly investigation. Using the Old Norse saga of Hr\'omundur as a case
study, this article demonstrates that stemmas can serve as a starting point for
exploring textual traditions further. In doing so, they enable us to address
research questions that otherwise remain unanswered. The article is accompanied
by datasets used to generate stemmas for the Hr\'omundar saga tradition as well
as two custom Python scripts. The scripts are designed to convert XML-based
textual data, encoded according to the TEI Guidelines, into the input format
used for the analysis in the PHYLIP package to generate unrooted trees of
relationships between texts.

TLDR: 论文提出了一种名为Hand-Shadow Poser的三阶段流程，用于解决给定目标形状时如何生成左右手姿势以形成相似阴影的逆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决在巨大且受解剖学限制的3D手部姿势设计空间中，如何生成能够匹配输入目标形状的手影艺术。

Method: 方法包括三个阶段：(i)生成手部分配模块探索合理的手部形状假设；(ii)广义手影对齐模块推断粗略手部姿势；(iii)阴影特征感知细化模块优化手部姿势。

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法在85%的基准案例中能有效生成多样化的双手姿势。

Conclusion: 结论是该方法能够高效解决手影艺术的逆问题，且无需专用训练数据。

Abstract: Hand shadow art is a captivating art form, creatively using hand shadows to
reproduce expressive shapes on the wall. In this work, we study an inverse
problem: given a target shape, find the poses of left and right hands that
together best produce a shadow resembling the input. This problem is
nontrivial, since the design space of 3D hand poses is huge while being
restrictive due to anatomical constraints. Also, we need to attend to the
input's shape and crucial features, though the input is colorless and
textureless. To meet these challenges, we design Hand-Shadow Poser, a
three-stage pipeline, to decouple the anatomical constraints (by hand) and
semantic constraints (by shadow shape): (i) a generative hand assignment module
to explore diverse but reasonable left/right-hand shape hypotheses; (ii) a
generalized hand-shadow alignment module to infer coarse hand poses with a
similarity-driven strategy for selecting hypotheses; and (iii) a
shadow-feature-aware refinement module to optimize the hand poses for physical
plausibility and shadow feature preservation. Further, we design our pipeline
to be trainable on generic public hand data, thus avoiding the need for any
specialized training dataset. For method validation, we build a benchmark of
210 diverse shadow shapes of varying complexity and a comprehensive set of
metrics, including a novel DINOv2-based evaluation metric. Through extensive
comparisons with multiple baselines and user studies, our approach is
demonstrated to effectively generate bimanual hand poses for a large variety of
hand shapes for over 85% of the benchmark cases.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在动态反馈经济市场中模拟人类行为的潜力。

Method: 通过动态反馈机制比较LLMs与实验室市场行为，评估其与人类行为的对齐。

Result: LLMs显示有限理性，能复现人类实验趋势，但行为异质性较低。

Conclusion: LLMs有望模拟人类经济行为，但需进一步研究提升准确性和多样性。

Abstract: We explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to replicate human
behavior in economic market experiments. Compared to previous studies, we focus
on dynamic feedback between LLM agents: the decisions of each LLM impact the
market price at the current step, and so affect the decisions of the other LLMs
at the next step. We compare LLM behavior to market dynamics observed in
laboratory settings and assess their alignment with human participants'
behavior. Our findings indicate that LLMs do not adhere strictly to rational
expectations, displaying instead bounded rationality, similarly to human
participants. Providing a minimal context window i.e. memory of three previous
time steps, combined with a high variability setting capturing response
heterogeneity, allows LLMs to replicate broad trends seen in human experiments,
such as the distinction between positive and negative feedback markets.
However, differences remain at a granular level--LLMs exhibit less
heterogeneity in behavior than humans. These results suggest that LLMs hold
promise as tools for simulating realistic human behavior in economic contexts,
though further research is needed to refine their accuracy and increase
behavioral diversity.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Following up on our earlier study in [J. Bardhan et al., Machine
learning-enhanced search for a vectorlike singlet B quark decaying to a singlet
scalar or pseudoscalar, Phys. Rev. D 107 (2023) 115001; arXiv:2212.02442], we
investigate the LHC prospects of pair-produced vectorlike $B$ quarks decaying
exotically to a new gauge-singlet (pseudo)scalar field $\Phi$ and a $b$ quark.
After the electroweak symmetry breaking, the $\Phi$ decays predominantly to
$gg/bb$ final states, leading to a fully hadronic $2b+4j$ or $6b$ signature.
Because of the large Standard Model background and the lack of leptonic
handles, it is a difficult channel to probe. To overcome the challenge, we
employ a hybrid deep learning model containing a graph neural network followed
by a deep neural network. We estimate that such a state-of-the-art deep
learning analysis pipeline can lead to a performance comparable to that in the
semi-leptonic mode, taking the discovery (exclusion) reach up to about
$M_B=1.8\:(2.4)$~TeV at HL-LHC when $B$ decays fully exotically, i.e., BR$(B
\to b\Phi) = 100\%$.

TLDR: NewsNet-SDF是一种新颖的深度学习框架，通过对抗网络将预训练语言模型嵌入与金融时间序列数据结合，显著提升了资产定价和风险评估的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统随机折现因子（SDF）模型难以整合非结构化文本信息，而金融市场中新闻等文本数据对资产定价有重要影响。

Method: 采用多模态架构，结合GTE多语言模型处理金融新闻、LSTM网络提取宏观经济数据的时间模式，并通过对抗训练机制融合异构数据。

Result: 在1980-2022年美国股票数据上，NewsNet-SDF的夏普比率达2.80，显著优于传统模型（如CAPM、Fama-French五因子模型）。

Conclusion: 该研究验证了多模态深度学习在整合非结构化文本与传统金融数据中的有效性，为金融科技中的智能决策提供了新见解。

Abstract: Stochastic Discount Factor (SDF) models provide a unified framework for asset
pricing and risk assessment, yet traditional formulations struggle to
incorporate unstructured textual information. We introduce NewsNet-SDF, a novel
deep learning framework that seamlessly integrates pretrained language model
embeddings with financial time series through adversarial networks. Our
multimodal architecture processes financial news using GTE-multilingual models,
extracts temporal patterns from macroeconomic data via LSTM networks, and
normalizes firm characteristics, fusing these heterogeneous information sources
through an innovative adversarial training mechanism. Our dataset encompasses
approximately 2.5 million news articles and 10,000 unique securities,
addressing the computational challenges of processing and aligning text data
with financial time series. Empirical evaluations on U.S. equity data
(1980-2022) demonstrate NewsNet-SDF substantially outperforms alternatives with
a Sharpe ratio of 2.80. The model shows a 471% improvement over CAPM, over 200%
improvement versus traditional SDF implementations, and a 74% reduction in
pricing errors compared to the Fama-French five-factor model. In comprehensive
comparisons, our deep learning approach consistently outperforms traditional,
modern, and other neural asset pricing models across all key metrics. Ablation
studies confirm that text embeddings contribute significantly more to model
performance than macroeconomic features, with news-derived principal components
ranking among the most influential determinants of SDF dynamics. These results
validate the effectiveness of our multimodal deep learning approach in
integrating unstructured text with traditional financial data for more accurate
asset pricing, providing new insights for digital intelligent decision-making
in financial technology.

Motivation: 随着双层次优化在近年来的成功，类似方法开始应用于更复杂的三层次优化问题，需要高效且理论可靠的随机方法。

Method: 提出了一种随机梯度下降方法，解决了三层次伴随梯度的不精确性，包括中低层次问题的近似解、伴随公式的近似计算以及梯度、Hessian、Jacobian和三阶导数张量的噪声估计。

Conclusion: 该方法在三层次优化问题中表现出良好的潜力，为复杂优化问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: With the success that the field of bilevel optimization has seen in recent
years, similar methodologies have started being applied to solving more
difficult applications that arise in trilevel optimization. At the helm of
these applications are new machine learning formulations that have been
proposed in the trilevel context and, as a result, efficient and theoretically
sound stochastic methods are required. In this work, we propose the first-ever
stochastic gradient descent method for solving unconstrained trilevel
optimization problems and provide a convergence theory that covers all forms of
inexactness of the trilevel adjoint gradient, such as the inexact solutions of
the middle-level and lower-level problems, inexact computation of the trilevel
adjoint formula, and noisy estimates of the gradients, Hessians, Jacobians, and
tensors of third-order derivatives involved. We also demonstrate the promise of
our approach by providing numerical results on both synthetic trilevel problems
and trilevel formulations for hyperparameter adversarial tuning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受泛化理论启发，旨在解决验证集表现良好但测试集表现不佳的问题，尤其是针对不稳定模型。

Method: 采用嵌套k折交叉验证，结合交叉验证指标和模型稳定性度量，权重通过嵌套交叉验证选择。

Result: 在13个UCI数据集上测试，稀疏岭回归和CART的样本外MSE平均提升4%，但对XGBoost无影响。

Conclusion: 该方法对不稳定模型（如稀疏回归和CART）有效且计算高效，适合提升测试集性能。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of ensuring strong test-set performance via
cross-validation. Motivated by the generalization theory literature, we propose
a nested k-fold cross-validation scheme that selects hyperparameters by
minimizing a weighted sum of the usual cross-validation metric and an empirical
model-stability measure. The weight on the stability term is itself chosen via
a nested cross-validation procedure. This reduces the risk of strong validation
set performance and poor test set performance due to instability. We benchmark
our procedure on a suite of 13 real-world UCI datasets, and find that, compared
to k-fold cross-validation over the same hyperparameters, it improves the
out-of-sample MSE for sparse ridge regression and CART by 4% on average, but
has no impact on XGBoost. This suggests that for interpretable and unstable
models, such as sparse regression and CART, our approach is a viable and
computationally affordable method for improving test-set performance.

Result: 在固定熵正则化下，证明了均值场动力学对混合纳什均衡的指数收敛速率；模拟退火版本可收敛到未正则化问题的均衡。

Conclusion: 该方法在收敛速率和时间尺度处理上优于现有方法，为多玩家零和博弈的均衡求解提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The approximation of mixed Nash equilibria (MNE) for zero-sum games with
mean-field interacting players has recently raised much interest in machine
learning. In this paper we propose a mean-field gradient descent dynamics for
finding the MNE of zero-sum games involving $K$ players with $K\geq 2$. The
evolution of the players' strategy distributions follows coupled mean-field
gradient descent flows with momentum, incorporating an exponentially discounted
time-averaging of gradients. First, in the case of a fixed entropic
regularization, we prove an exponential convergence rate for the mean-field
dynamics to the mixed Nash equilibrium with respect to the total variation
metric. This improves a previous polynomial convergence rate for a similar
time-averaged dynamics with different averaging factors. Moreover, unlike
previous two-scale approaches for finding the MNE, our approach treats all
player types on the same time scale. We also show that with a suitable choice
of decreasing temperature, a simulated annealing version of the mean-field
dynamics converges to an MNE of the initial unregularized problem.

Motivation: 由于云服务中CPU种类繁多且缺乏统一的向量搜索基准测试，用户难以选择最适合的CPU。

Method: 通过比较不同CPU微架构（如AMD Zen4、Intel Sapphire Rapids和Graviton3）在向量搜索场景中的性能（如QPS和QP$）。

Result: AMD Zen4在IVF索引下性能优于Intel Sapphire Rapids，但HNSW索引下相反；Graviton3在性价比上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究结果为用户选择性价比最高的向量搜索系统提供了指导。

Abstract: Vector databases have emerged as a new type of systems that support efficient
querying of high-dimensional vectors. Many of these offer their database as a
service in the cloud. However, the variety of available CPUs and the lack of
vector search benchmarks across CPUs make it difficult for users to choose one.
In this study, we show that CPU microarchitectures available in the cloud
perform significantly differently across vector search scenarios. For instance,
in an IVF index on float32 vectors, AMD's Zen4 gives almost 3x more queries per
second (QPS) compared to Intel's Sapphire Rapids, but for HNSW indexes, the
tables turn. However, when looking at the number of queries per dollar (QP$),
Graviton3 is the best option for most indexes and quantization settings, even
over Graviton4 (Table 1). With this work, we hope to guide users in getting the
best "bang for the buck" when deploying vector search systems.

Result: 完全信息下，责任间隙为空当且仅当机制为选举独裁；不完全信息下，无间隙机制类位于两种选举独裁变体之间。

Conclusion: 选举独裁是消除责任间隙的关键机制设计，尤其在完全信息下表现最佳。

Abstract: The responsibility gap is a set of outcomes of a collective decision-making
mechanism in which no single agent is individually responsible. In general,
when designing a decision-making process, it is desirable to minimise the gap.
  The paper proposes a concept of an elected dictatorship. It shows that, in a
perfect information setting, the gap is empty if and only if the mechanism is
an elected dictatorship. It also proves that in an imperfect information
setting, the class of gap-free mechanisms is positioned strictly between two
variations of the class of elected dictatorships.

Abstract: With the advancement of large language models and embodied Artificial
Intelligence (AI) in the intelligent transportation scenarios, the combination
of them in intelligent transportation spawns the Vehicular Embodied AI Network
(VEANs). In VEANs, Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are typical agents whose local
advanced AI applications are defined as vehicular embodied AI agents, enabling
capabilities such as environment perception and multi-agent collaboration. Due
to computation latency and resource constraints, the local AI applications and
services running on vehicular embodied AI agents need to be migrated, and
subsequently referred to as vehicular embodied AI agent twins, which drive the
advancement of vehicular embodied AI networks to offload intensive tasks to
Roadside Units (RSUs), mitigating latency problems while maintaining service
quality. Recognizing workload imbalance among RSUs in traditional approaches,
we model AV-RSU interactions as a Stackelberg game to optimize bandwidth
resource allocation for efficient migration. A Tiny Multi-Agent Bidirectional
LSTM Proximal Policy Optimization (TMABLPPO) algorithm is designed to
approximate the Stackelberg equilibrium through decentralized coordination.
Furthermore, a personalized neural network pruning algorithm based on Path
eXclusion (PX) dynamically adapts to heterogeneous AV computation capabilities
by identifying task-critical parameters in trained models, reducing model
complexity with less performance degradation. Experimental validation confirms
the algorithm's effectiveness in balancing system load and minimizing delays,
demonstrating significant improvements in vehicular embodied AI agent
deployment.

Motivation: 现实市场中存在多源异构数据，而现有方法多关注单一模型处理异构数据，忽略了多个竞争性ML提供商的市场动态。

Method: 提出Heterogeneous Data Game博弈框架，分析不同市场结构（垄断、双寡头等）下的纯纳什均衡（PNE），并探讨数据源选择模型的“温度”和主导数据源对均衡的影响。

Result: 研究发现PNE可能不存在、同质（所有提供商收敛于同一模型）或异质（提供商专注于不同数据源），具体取决于市场结构和数据特性。

Conclusion: 研究为竞争性ML市场的监管政策和实践策略提供了理论指导，揭示了均衡形态的多样性及其驱动因素。

Abstract: Data heterogeneity across multiple sources is common in real-world machine
learning (ML) settings. Although many methods focus on enabling a single model
to handle diverse data, real-world markets often comprise multiple competing ML
providers. In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic framework -- the
Heterogeneous Data Game -- to analyze how such providers compete across
heterogeneous data sources. We investigate the resulting pure Nash equilibria
(PNE), showing that they can be non-existent, homogeneous (all providers
converge on the same model), or heterogeneous (providers specialize in distinct
data sources). Our analysis spans monopolistic, duopolistic, and more general
markets, illustrating how factors such as the "temperature" of data-source
choice models and the dominance of certain data sources shape equilibrium
outcomes. We offer theoretical insights into both homogeneous and heterogeneous
PNEs, guiding regulatory policies and practical strategies for competitive ML
marketplaces.

Motivation: NISQ时代的量子计算机受限于噪声门，现有量子电路编译算法仅适用于小规模电路，且不适用于下游门最小化任务，LLM有望改进这一问题。

Method: 利用LLM（如Llama和Mistral）理解和生成QASM代码的能力，通过微调LLM实现量子电路分区，采用Berkeley Quantum Synthesis Toolkit的快速分区方法。

Result: 实验表明，微调后的开源LLM在分区任务中达到53.4%的准确率，而现成的LLM无法正确分区。

Conclusion: LLM在量子电路分区中具有潜力，通过精细微调可显著提升分区准确性。

Abstract: We are in the midst of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, where
quantum computers are limited by noisy gates, some of which are more
error-prone than others and can render the final computation incomprehensible.
Quantum circuit compilation algorithms attempt to minimize these noisy gates
when mapping quantum algorithms onto quantum hardware but face computational
challenges that restrict their application to circuits with no more than 5-6
qubits, necessitating the need to partition large circuits before the
application of noisy quantum gate minimization algorithms. The existing
generation of these algorithms is heuristic in nature and does not account for
downstream gate minimization tasks. Large language models (LLMs) have the
potential to change this and help improve quantum circuit partitions. This
paper investigates the use of LLMs, such as Llama and Mistral, for partitioning
quantum circuits by capitalizing on their abilities to understand and generate
code, including QASM. Specifically, we teach LLMs to partition circuits using
the quick partition approach of the Berkeley Quantum Synthesis Toolkit. Through
experimental evaluations, we show that careful fine-tuning of open source LLMs
enables us to obtain an accuracy of 53.4% for the partition task while
over-the-shelf LLMs are unable to correctly partition circuits, using standard
1-shot and few-shot training approaches.

Motivation: 解决深度生成模型在分子几何建模中面临的连续3D位置和离散2D拓扑的多模态概率路径扭曲问题。

Method: 通过优化变分下界（VLB）作为路径积分，提出VLB-Optimal Scheduling（VOS）策略，用于结构药物设计。

Conclusion: VOS策略在分子几何建模和相互作用预测中表现出色，为结构药物设计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) is crucial for identifying bioactive
molecules. Recent deep generative models are faced with challenges in geometric
structure modeling. A major bottleneck lies in the twisted probability path of
multi-modalities -- continuous 3D positions and discrete 2D topologies -- which
jointly determine molecular geometries. By establishing the fact that noise
schedules decide the Variational Lower Bound (VLB) for the twisted probability
path, we propose VLB-Optimal Scheduling (VOS) strategy in this under-explored

*Tianhao Cai,Liang Wang,Limin Xiao,Meng Han,Zeyu Wang,Lin Sun,Xiaojian Liao*

Main category: cs.AR

TLDR: CaMDN通过架构与调度协同设计，提升多租户DNN在共享缓存中的效率，减少内存访问并加速模型运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着DNN应用的快速发展，多租户执行成为趋势，但共享缓存的影响未被充分研究。

Method: 提出轻量级架构支持模型独占缓存区域，并设计缓存调度方法优化共享缓存利用率。

Result: 平均减少33.4%内存访问，模型加速最高达2.56倍（平均1.88倍）。

Conclusion: CaMDN有效解决了多租户DNN中的缓存争用问题，显著提升性能。

Abstract: With the rapid development of DNN applications, multi-tenant execution, where
multiple DNNs are co-located on a single SoC, is becoming a prevailing trend.
Although many methods are proposed in prior works to improve multi-tenant
performance, the impact of shared cache is not well studied. This paper
proposes CaMDN, an architecture-scheduling co-design to enhance cache
efficiency for multi-tenant DNNs on integrated NPUs. Specifically, a
lightweight architecture is proposed to support model-exclusive, NPU-controlled
regions inside shared cache to eliminate unexpected cache contention. Moreover,
a cache scheduling method is proposed to improve shared cache utilization. In
particular, it includes a cache-aware mapping method for adaptability to the
varying available cache capacity and a dynamic allocation algorithm to adjust
the usage among co-located DNNs at runtime. Compared to prior works, CaMDN
reduces the memory access by 33.4% on average and achieves a model speedup of
up to 2.56$\times$ (1.88$\times$ on average).

Abstract: Digital Predistortion (DPD) is a popular technique to enhance signal quality
in wideband RF power amplifiers (PAs). With increasing bandwidth and data
rates, DPD faces significant energy consumption challenges during deployment,
contrasting with its efficiency goals. State-of-the-art DPD models rely on

energy-efficient DPD, reducing arithmetic operations and memory accesses while
preserving satisfactory linearization performance. Applying a TM3.1a 200MHz-BW
256-QAM OFDM signal to a 3.5 GHz GaN Doherty RF PA, DeltaDPD achieves -50.03
dBc in Adjacent Channel Power Ratio (ACPR), -37.22 dB in Normalized Mean Square
Error (NMSE) and -38.52 dBc in Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) with 52% temporal
sparsity, leading to a 1.8X reduction in estimated inference power. The

Motivation: 现有频谱管理方法在复杂动态环境中存在识别精度低、收敛速度慢和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: SpectrumFM采用创新的编码器架构，结合卷积神经网络和多头自注意力机制，并通过自监督学习任务（掩码重建和下一时隙信号预测）进行预训练。

Result: 实验表明，SpectrumFM在多个任务中表现优异，如AMC精度提升12.1%，WTC精度提升9.3%，SS任务中AUC达0.97，AD性能提升10%。

Conclusion: SpectrumFM为频谱管理提供了高效、鲁棒且适应性强的解决方案，显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: Intelligent spectrum management is crucial for improving spectrum efficiency
and achieving secure utilization of spectrum resources. However, existing
intelligent spectrum management methods, typically based on small-scale models,
suffer from notable limitations in recognition accuracy, convergence speed, and
generalization, particularly in the complex and dynamic spectrum environments.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel spectrum foundation
model, termed SpectrumFM, establishing a new paradigm for spectrum management.
SpectrumFM features an innovative encoder architecture that synergistically
exploits the convolutional neural networks and the multi-head self-attention
mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and enable robust representation
learning. The model is pre-trained via two novel self-supervised learning
tasks, namely masked reconstruction and next-slot signal prediction, which
leverage large-scale in-phase and quadrature (IQ) data to achieve comprehensive
and transferable spectrum representations. Furthermore, a parameter-efficient
fine-tuning strategy is proposed to enable SpectrumFM to adapt to various
downstream spectrum management tasks, including automatic modulation
classification (AMC), wireless technology classification (WTC), spectrum
sensing (SS), and anomaly detection (AD). Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SpectrumFM achieves superior performance in terms of accuracy, robustness,
adaptability, few-shot learning efficiency, and convergence speed, consistently
outperforming conventional methods across multiple benchmarks. Specifically,
SpectrumFM improves AMC accuracy by up to 12.1% and WTC accuracy by 9.3%,
achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97 in SS at -4 dB signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR), and enhances AD performance by over 10%.

Motivation: 太赫兹通信在6G系统中具有潜力，但其信号传播特性与传统频段不同，导致现有信道建模方法效率低下。

Method: 通过构建模拟THz场景，利用RRF框架重建连续辐射场，并基于稀疏测量实现空间信道状态信息（Spatial-CSI）建模。

Result: 实验表明，RRF能够通过稀疏样本捕捉关键传播路径，重建质量高且适用于THz通信。

Conclusion: RRF在THz频段仍有效，为未来6G网络的可扩展、低成本空间信道重建提供了新方向。

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication is a key enabler for 6G systems, offering
ultra-wide bandwidth and unprecedented data rates. However, THz signal
propagation differs significantly from lower-frequency bands due to severe free
space path loss, minimal diffraction and specular reflection, and prominent
scattering, making conventional channel modeling and pilot-based estimation
approaches inefficient. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of
applying radio radiance field (RRF) framework to the THz band. This method
reconstructs a continuous RRF using visual-based geometry and sparse THz RF
measurements, enabling efficient spatial channel state information
(Spatial-CSI) modeling without dense sampling. We first build a fine simulated
THz scenario, then we reconstruct the RRF and evaluate the performance in terms
of both reconstruction quality and effectiveness in THz communication, showing
that the reconstructed RRF captures key propagation paths with sparse training
samples. Our findings demonstrate that RRF modeling remains effective in the
THz regime and provides a promising direction for scalable, low-cost spatial
channel reconstruction in future 6G networks.

Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing has emerged as a significant technology in wireless sensing and
Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC), offering benefits such as low
cost, high penetration, and enhanced privacy. Currently, it is widely utilized
in various applications, including action recognition, human localization, and
crowd counting. However, Wi-Fi sensing also faces challenges, such as low
robustness and difficulties in data collection. Recently, there has been an
increasing focus on multi-modal Wi-Fi sensing, where other modalities can act
as teachers, providing ground truth or robust features for Wi-Fi sensing models
to learn from, or can be directly fused with Wi-Fi for enhanced sensing
capabilities. Although these methods have demonstrated promising results and
substantial value in practical applications, there is a lack of comprehensive
surveys reviewing them. To address this gap, this paper reviews the multi-modal
Wi-Fi sensing literature \textbf{from the past 24 months} and highlights the
current limitations, challenges and future directions in this field.

Abstract: Rolling bearings are critical components of rotating machinery, and their
proper functioning is essential for industrial production. Most existing
condition monitoring methods focus on extracting discriminative features from
time-domain signals to assess bearing health status. However, under complex
operating conditions, periodic impulsive characteristics related to fault
information are often obscured by noise interference. Consequently, existing
approaches struggle to learn distinctive fault-related features in such
scenarios. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel CNN-based model
named FEMSN. Specifically, a Fourier Adaptive Denoising Encoder Layer (FADEL)
is introduced as an input denoising layer to enhance key features while
filtering out irrelevant information. Subsequently, a Multiscale Time-Frequency
Fusion (MSTFF) module is employed to extract fused time-frequency features,
further improving the model robustness and nonlinear representation capability.
Additionally, a distillation layer is incorporated to expand the receptive
field. Based on these advancements, a novel deep lightweight CNN model, termed
the Frequency-Enhanced Multiscale Network (FEMSN), is developed. The
effectiveness of FEMSN and FADEL in machine health monitoring and stability
assessment is validated through two case studies.

Abstract: The dynamic nature of human health and comfort calls for adaptive systems
that respond to individual physiological needs in real time. This paper
presents an AI-enhanced digital twin framework that integrates biometric
signals, specifically electrocardiogram (ECG) data, with environmental
parameters such as temperature, humidity, and ventilation. Leveraging
IoT-enabled sensors and biometric monitoring devices, the system continuously
acquires, synchronises, and preprocesses multimodal data streams to construct a
responsive virtual replica of the physical environment. To validate this
framework, a detailed case study is conducted using the MIT-BIH noise stress
test dataset. ECG signals are filtered and segmented using dynamic sliding
windows, followed by extracting heart rate variability (HRV) features such as
SDNN, BPM, QTc, and LF/HF ratio. Relative deviation metrics are computed
against clean baselines to quantify stress responses. A random forest
classifier is trained to predict stress levels across five categories, and
Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is used to interpret model behaviour and
identify key contributing features. These predictions are mapped to a
structured set of environmental interventions using a Five Level Stress
Intervention Mapping, which activates multi-scale responses across personal,
room, building, and landscape levels. This integration of physiological
insight, explainable AI, and adaptive control establishes a new paradigm for
health-responsive built environments. It lays the foundation for the future

Result: 经过25,000小时预训练，ALFEE在六个下游EEG任务中表现优于现有模型。

Conclusion: ALFEE为生物信号分析提供了一个可扩展的基础框架。

Abstract: While foundation models excel in text, image, and video domains, the critical
biological signals, particularly electroencephalography(EEG), remain
underexplored. EEG benefits neurological research with its high temporal
resolution, operational practicality, and safety profile. However, low
signal-to-noise ratio, inter-subject variability, and cross-paradigm
differences hinder the generalization of current models. Existing methods often
employ simplified strategies, such as a single loss function or a
channel-temporal joint representation module, and suffer from a domain gap
between pretraining and evaluation tasks that compromises efficiency and
adaptability. To address these limitations, we propose the Adaptive Large
Foundation model for EEG signal representation(ALFEE) framework, a novel hybrid
transformer architecture with two learning stages for robust EEG representation
learning. ALFEE employs a hybrid attention that separates channel-wise feature
aggregation from temporal dynamics modeling, enabling robust EEG representation
with variable channel configurations. A channel encoder adaptively compresses
variable channel information, a temporal encoder captures task-guided
evolution, and a hybrid decoder reconstructs signals in both temporal and
frequency domains. During pretraining, ALFEE optimizes task prediction, channel
and temporal mask reconstruction, and temporal forecasting to enhance
multi-scale and multi-channel representation. During fine-tuning, a full-model
adaptation with a task-specific token dictionary and a cross-attention layer
boosts performance across multiple tasks. After 25,000 hours of pretraining,
extensive experimental results on six downstream EEG tasks demonstrate the
superior performance of ALFEE over existing models. Our ALFEE framework
establishes a scalable foundation for biological signal analysis with
implementation at https://github.com/xw1216/ALFEE.

TLDR: 本文研究了超大规模MIMO（XL-MIMO）系统中的近场（NF）信道估计（CE），提出了一种基于联合角度-距离（AD）域的稀疏信号重建方法，并结合生成式人工智能（GenAI）优化估计结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于XL-MIMO通信中显著的近场效应，传统信道估计方法性能受限，需要一种更高效的方法来捕捉信道的稀疏性并提升估计精度。

Method: 首先建立基于球面波前的联合AD域信道模型，利用压缩感知算法初步估计信道；随后引入生成式扩散模型（GDM）及其非马尔可夫版本（NM-GDM）优化估计结果。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提方法在近场XL-MIMO系统中显著优于现有基准方案，且在近场和远场区域均表现出更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过结合稀疏信号重建和生成式AI，本文提出的方法在信道估计中实现了性能提升和效率优化，为XL-MIMO系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates the near-field (NF) channel estimation (CE) for
extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems.
Considering the pronounced NF effects in XL-MIMO communications, we first
establish a joint angle-distance (AD) domain-based spherical-wavefront physical
channel model that captures the inherent sparsity of XL-MIMO channels.
Leveraging the channel's sparsity in the joint AD domain, the CE is approached
as a task of reconstructing sparse signals. Anchored in this framework, we
first propose a compressed sensing algorithm to acquire a preliminary channel
estimate. Harnessing the powerful implicit prior learning capability of
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), we further propose a GenAI-based
approach to refine the estimated channel. Specifically, we introduce the
preliminary estimated channel as side information, and derive the evidence
lower bound (ELBO) of the log-marginal distribution of the target NF channel
conditioned on the preliminary estimated channel, which serves as the
optimization objective for the proposed generative diffusion model (GDM).
Additionally, we introduce a more generalized version of the GDM, the
non-Markovian GDM (NM-GDM), to accelerate the sampling process, achieving an
approximately tenfold enhancement in sampling efficiency. Experimental results
indicate that the proposed approach is capable of offering substantial
performance gain in CE compared to existing benchmark schemes within NF XL-MIMO
systems. Furthermore, our approach exhibits enhanced generalization
capabilities in both the NF or far-field (FF) regions.

Conclusion: MambaBF是一种高效且适应性强的干扰抑制解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate downlink co-frequency interference (CFI)
mitigation in non-geostationary satellites orbits (NGSOs) co-existing systems.
Traditional mitigation techniques, such as Zero-forcing (ZF), produce a null
towards the direction of arrivals (DOAs) of the interfering signals, but they
suffer from high computational complexity due to matrix inversions and required
knowledge of the channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, adaptive
beamformers, such as sample matrix inversion (SMI)-based minimum variance,
provide poor performance when the available snapshots are limited. We propose a
Mamba-based beamformer (MambaBF) that leverages an unsupervised deep learning
(DL) approach and can be deployed on the user terminal (UT) antenna array, for
assisting downlink beamforming and CFI mitigation using only a limited number
of available array snapshots as input, and without CSI knowledge. Simulation
results demonstrate that MambaBF consistently outperforms conventional
beamforming techniques in mitigating interference and maximizing the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), particularly under challenging
conditions characterized by low SINR, limited snapshots, and imperfect CSI.

Conclusion: Burger通过多语义建模和去噪技术，显著提升了社交推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: In the era of rapid development of social media, social recommendation
systems as hybrid recommendation systems have been widely applied. Existing
methods capture interest similarity between users to filter out
interest-irrelevant relations in social networks that inevitably decrease
recommendation accuracy, however, limited research has a focus on the mutual
influence of semantic information between the social network and the user-item
interaction network for further improving social recommendation. To address
these issues, we introduce a social \underline{r}ecommendation model with
ro\underline{bu}st g\underline{r}aph denoisin\underline{g}-augmentation fusion
and multi-s\underline{e}mantic Modeling(Burger). Specifically, we firstly
propose to construct a social tensor in order to smooth the training process of
the model. Then, a graph convolutional network and a tensor convolutional
network are employed to capture user's item preference and social preference,
respectively. Considering the different semantic information in the user-item
interaction network and the social network, a bi-semantic coordination loss is
proposed to model the mutual influence of semantic information. To alleviate
the interference of interest-irrelevant relations on multi-semantic modeling,
we further use Bayesian posterior probability to mine potential social
relations to replace social noise. Finally, the sliding window mechanism is
utilized to update the social tensor as the input for the next iteration.
Extensive experiments on three real datasets show Burger has a superior
performance compared with the state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: 通过感知一致性和排名损失，学生模型能有效模仿教师模型，提升特征表示迁移效果。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for transferring feature representation to
lightweight student models from larger teacher models. We mathematically define
a new notion called \textit{perception coherence}. Based on this notion, we
propose a loss function, which takes into account the dissimilarities between
data points in feature space through their ranking. At a high level, by
minimizing this loss function, the student model learns to mimic how the
teacher model \textit{perceives} inputs. More precisely, our method is
motivated by the fact that the representational capacity of the student model
is weaker than the teacher model. Hence, we aim to develop a new method
allowing for a better relaxation. This means that, the student model does not
need to preserve the absolute geometry of the teacher one, while preserving
global coherence through dissimilarity ranking. Our theoretical insights
provide a probabilistic perspective on the process of feature representation
transfer. Our experiments results show that our method outperforms or achieves
on-par performance compared to strong baseline methods for representation
transferring.

Method: 提出EIPM度量公平性，并基于此设计FREM算法，利用有限样本准确估计EIPM。

Result: FREM在实验中优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: FREM为连续敏感属性的公平表示学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: AI fairness, also known as algorithmic fairness, aims to ensure that
algorithms operate without bias or discrimination towards any individual or
group. Among various AI algorithms, the Fair Representation Learning (FRL)
approach has gained significant interest in recent years. However, existing FRL
algorithms have a limitation: they are primarily designed for categorical
sensitive attributes and thus cannot be applied to continuous sensitive
attributes, such as age or income. In this paper, we propose an FRL algorithm
for continuous sensitive attributes. First, we introduce a measure called the
Expectation of Integral Probability Metrics (EIPM) to assess the fairness level
of representation space for continuous sensitive attributes. We demonstrate
that if the distribution of the representation has a low EIPM value, then any
prediction head constructed on the top of the representation become fair,
regardless of the selection of the prediction head. Furthermore, EIPM possesses
a distinguished advantage in that it can be accurately estimated using our
proposed estimator with finite samples. Based on these properties, we propose a
new FRL algorithm called Fair Representation using EIPM with MMD (FREM).
Experimental evidences show that FREM outperforms other baseline methods.

Conclusion: 本文通过理论证明了IWOGA + HDIWIC在高维误设回归模型中的最优性，为模型选择提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Imori and Ing (2025) proposed the importance-weighted orthogonal greedy
algorithm (IWOGA) for model selection in high-dimensional misspecified
regression models under covariate shift. To determine the number of IWOGA
iterations, they introduced the high-dimensional importance-weighted
information criterion (HDIWIC). They argued that the combined use of IWOGA and
HDIWIC, IWOGA + HDIWIC, achieves an optimal trade-off between variance and
squared bias, leading to optimal convergence rates in terms of conditional mean
squared prediction error. In this article, we provide a theoretical
justification for this claim by establishing the optimality of IWOGA + HDIWIC
under a set of reasonable assumptions.

Abstract: In this work, we study the learning theory of reward modeling with pairwise
comparison data using deep neural networks. We establish a novel non-asymptotic
regret bound for deep reward estimators in a non-parametric setting, which
depends explicitly on the network architecture. Furthermore, to underscore the
critical importance of clear human beliefs, we introduce a margin-type
condition that assumes the conditional winning probability of the optimal
action in pairwise comparisons is significantly distanced from 1/2. This
condition enables a sharper regret bound, which substantiates the empirical
efficiency of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and highlights clear
human beliefs in its success. Notably, this improvement stems from high-quality
pairwise comparison data implied by the margin-type condition, is independent
of the specific estimators used, and thus applies to various learning
algorithms and models.

Abstract: The problem of using proximity (similarity or dissimilarity) data for the
purpose of "adding a point to a vector diagram" was first studied by J.C. Gower
in 1968. Since then, a number of methods -- mostly kernel methods -- have been
proposed for solving what has come to be called the problem of *out-of-sample
embedding*. We survey the various kernel methods that we have encountered and
show that each can be derived from one or the other of two competing
strategies: *projection* or *restricted reconstruction*. Projection can be
analogized to a well-known formula for adding a point to a principal component
analysis. Restricted reconstruction poses a different challenge: how to best
approximate redoing the entire multivariate analysis while holding fixed the
vector diagram that was previously obtained. This strategy results in a
nonlinear optimization problem that can be simplified to a unidimensional
search. Various circumstances may warrant either projection or restricted
reconstruction.

Conclusion: FBSDE框架为扩散生成模型提供了新视角，适用于贝叶斯统计中的采样问题。

Abstract: Recently, there has been a growing interest in generative models based on
diffusions driven by the empirical robustness of these methods in generating
high-dimensional photorealistic images and the possibility of using the vast
existing toolbox of stochastic differential equations. %This remarkable ability
may stem from their capacity to model and generate multimodal distributions. In
this work, we offer a novel perspective on the approach introduced in Song et
al. (2021), shifting the focus from a "learning" problem to a "sampling"
problem. To achieve this, we reformulate the equations governing
diffusion-based generative models as a Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential
Equation (FBSDE), which avoids the well-known issue of pre-estimating the
gradient of the log target density. The solution of this FBSDE is proved to be
unique using non-standard techniques. Additionally, we propose a numerical
solution to this problem, leveraging on Deep Learning techniques. This
reformulation opens new pathways for sampling multidimensional distributions
with densities known up to a normalization constant, a problem frequently
encountered in Bayesian statistics.

Result: 通过实验验证了该方法在多种分类应用中的鲁棒性，能够实现跨不同不平衡率测试集的性能比较。

Conclusion: 超越分数函数为分类性能指标提供了一种通用且一致的标准化框架，解决了跨数据集比较的难题。

Abstract: Many classification performance metrics exist, each suited to a specific
application. However, these metrics often differ in scale and can exhibit
varying sensitivity to class imbalance rates in the test set. As a result, it
is difficult to use the nominal values of these metrics to interpret and
evaluate classification performances, especially when imbalance rates vary. To
address this problem, we introduce the outperformance score function, a
universal standardization method for confusion-matrix-based classification
performance (CMBCP) metrics. It maps any given metric to a common scale of
$[0,1]$, while providing a clear and consistent interpretation. Specifically,
the outperformance score represents the percentile rank of the observed
classification performance within a reference distribution of possible
performances. This unified framework enables meaningful comparison and
monitoring of classification performance across test sets with differing
imbalance rates. We illustrate how the outperformance scores can be applied to
a variety of commonly used classification performance metrics and demonstrate
the robustness of our method through experiments on real-world datasets
spanning multiple classification applications.

Motivation: 统一两种关于神经缩放定律起源的观点：任务线性分解为幂律分布单元或数据具有层次组合结构。

Method: 使用基于概率上下文无关文法的分类和下一标记预测任务，分析幂律分布规则对学习曲线的影响。

Result: 分类任务中，幂律分布规则导致学习曲线呈幂律，指数由规则分布决定，而层次结构影响乘性常数；下一标记预测任务中，规则分布仅影响学习曲线的局部细节，不影响大尺度行为的指数。

Conclusion: 论文统一了神经缩放定律的两种起源观点，并通过具体任务展示了规则分布和层次结构对学习曲线的不同影响。

Abstract: Recent theories suggest that Neural Scaling Laws arise whenever the task is
linearly decomposed into power-law distributed units. Alternatively, scaling
laws also emerge when data exhibit a hierarchically compositional structure, as
is thought to occur in language and images. To unify these views, we consider
classification and next-token prediction tasks based on probabilistic
context-free grammars -- probabilistic models that generate data via a
hierarchy of production rules. For classification, we show that having
power-law distributed production rules results in a power-law learning curve
with an exponent depending on the rules' distribution and a large
multiplicative constant that depends on the hierarchical structure. By
contrast, for next-token prediction, the distribution of production rules
controls the local details of the learning curve, but not the exponent
describing the large-scale behaviour.

Conclusion: 提出的框架能唯一恢复交互核（尺度除外），并在实际应用中表现优异。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the data-driven identification of asymmetric
interaction kernels in the Motsch-Tadmor model based on observed trajectory
data. The model under consideration is governed by a class of semilinear
evolution equations, where the interaction kernel defines a normalized,
state-dependent Laplacian operator that governs collective dynamics. To address
the resulting nonlinear inverse problem, we propose a variational framework
that reformulates kernel identification using the implicit form of the
governing equations, reducing it to a subspace identification problem. We
establish an identifiability result that characterizes conditions under which
the interaction kernel can be uniquely recovered up to scale. To solve the
inverse problem robustly, we develop a sparse Bayesian learning algorithm that
incorporates informative priors for regularization, quantifies uncertainty, and
enables principled model selection. Extensive numerical experiments on
representative interacting particle systems demonstrate the accuracy,
robustness, and interpretability of the proposed framework across a range of
noise levels and data regimes.

Conclusion: 为理论和实践中的约束序列决策提供了原则性基础。

Abstract: Contextual online decision-making problems with constraints appear in a wide
range of real-world applications, such as personalized recommendation with
resource limits, adaptive experimental design, and decision-making under safety
or fairness requirements. In this paper, we investigate a general formulation
of sequential decision-making with stage-wise feasibility constraints, where at
each round, the learner must select an action based on observed context while
ensuring that a problem-specific feasibility criterion is satisfied. We propose
a unified algorithmic framework that captures many existing constrained
learning problems, including constrained bandits, active learning with label
budgets, online hypothesis testing with Type I error control, and model
calibration. Central to our approach is the concept of upper counterfactual
confidence bounds, which enables the design of practically efficient online
algorithms with strong theoretical guarantee using any offline conditional
density estimation oracle. Technically, to handle feasibility constraints in
complex environments, we introduce a generalized notion of the eluder dimension
- extending it from the classical setting based on square loss to a broader
class of metric-like probability divergences. This allows us to capture the
complexity of various density function classes and characterize the utility
regret incurred due to feasibility constraint uncertainty. Our result offers a
principled foundation for constrained sequential decision-making in both theory
and practice.

Abstract: In this thesis, we introduce Bayesian filtering as a principled framework for
tackling diverse sequential machine learning problems, including online
(continual) learning, prequential (one-step-ahead) forecasting, and contextual
bandits. To this end, this thesis addresses key challenges in applying Bayesian
filtering to these problems: adaptivity to non-stationary environments,
robustness to model misspecification and outliers, and scalability to the
high-dimensional parameter space of deep neural networks. We develop novel
tools within the Bayesian filtering framework to address each of these
challenges, including: (i) a modular framework that enables the development
adaptive approaches for online learning; (ii) a novel, provably robust filter
with similar computational cost to standard filters, that employs Generalised
Bayes; and (iii) a set of tools for sequentially updating model parameters
using approximate second-order optimisation methods that exploit the
overparametrisation of high-dimensional parametric models such as neural
networks. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate the improved
performance of our methods in dynamic, high-dimensional, and misspecified

Conclusion: ALPCAH为异方差数据提供有效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a key tool in the field of data
dimensionality reduction. However, some applications involve heterogeneous data
that vary in quality due to noise characteristics associated with each data
sample. Heteroscedastic methods aim to deal with such mixed data quality. This
paper develops a subspace learning method, named ALPCAH, that can estimate the
sample-wise noise variances and use this information to improve the estimate of
the subspace basis associated with the low-rank structure of the data. Our
method makes no distributional assumptions of the low-rank component and does
not assume that the noise variances are known. Further, this method uses a soft
rank constraint that does not require subspace dimension to be known.
Additionally, this paper develops a matrix factorized version of ALPCAH, named
LR-ALPCAH, that is much faster and more memory efficient at the cost of
requiring subspace dimension to be known or estimated. Simulations and real
data experiments show the effectiveness of accounting for data
heteroscedasticity compared to existing algorithms. Code available at

Result: 在高维情况下，单次牛顿步骤不足，但两次步骤可实现有效遗忘。

Conclusion: 该方法在高维环境中具有理论保证和实际可行性。

Abstract: Machine unlearning focuses on the computationally efficient removal of
specific training data from trained models, ensuring that the influence of
forgotten data is effectively eliminated without the need for full retraining.
Despite advances in low-dimensional settings, where the number of parameters \(
p \) is much smaller than the sample size \( n \), extending similar
theoretical guarantees to high-dimensional regimes remains challenging. We
propose an unlearning algorithm that starts from the original model parameters
and performs a theory-guided sequence of Newton steps \( T \in \{ 1,2\}\).
After this update, carefully scaled isotropic Laplacian noise is added to the
estimate to ensure that any (potential) residual influence of forget data is
completely removed. We show that when both \( n, p \to \infty \) with a fixed
ratio \( n/p \), significant theoretical and computational obstacles arise due
to the interplay between the complexity of the model and the finite
signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, we show that, unlike in low-dimensional
settings, a single Newton step is insufficient for effective unlearning in
high-dimensional problems -- however, two steps are enough to achieve the
desired certifiebility. We provide numerical experiments to support the
certifiability and accuracy claims of this approach.

Conclusion: 框架有效提升了贴现曲线估计的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We propose a framework for transfer learning of discount curves across
different fixed-income product classes. Motivated by challenges in estimating
discount curves from sparse or noisy data, we extend kernel ridge regression
(KR) to a vector-valued setting, formulating a convex optimization problem in a
vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Each component of the
solution corresponds to the discount curve implied by a specific product class.
We introduce an additional regularization term motivated by economic
principles, promoting smoothness of spread curves between product classes, and
show that it leads to a valid separable kernel structure. A main theoretical
contribution is a decomposition of the vector-valued RKHS norm induced by
separable kernels. We further provide a Gaussian process interpretation of
vector-valued KR, enabling quantification of estimation uncertainty.
Illustrative examples demonstrate that transfer learning significantly improves
extrapolation performance and tightens confidence intervals compared to
single-curve estimation.

Result: 研究发现，dropout能减少隐藏节点间的有害相关性，减轻标签噪声的影响，且最优dropout概率随数据噪声水平增加而提高。

Conclusion: 理论分析和数值模拟验证了dropout的有效性及其最优概率的依赖性。

Abstract: Dropout is a regularization technique widely used in training artificial
neural networks to mitigate overfitting. It consists of dynamically
deactivating subsets of the network during training to promote more robust
representations. Despite its widespread adoption, dropout probabilities are
often selected heuristically, and theoretical explanations of its success
remain sparse. Here, we analytically study dropout in two-layer neural networks
trained with online stochastic gradient descent. In the high-dimensional limit,
we derive a set of ordinary differential equations that fully characterize the
evolution of the network during training and capture the effects of dropout. We
obtain a number of exact results describing the generalization error and the
optimal dropout probability at short, intermediate, and long training times.
Our analysis shows that dropout reduces detrimental correlations between hidden
nodes, mitigates the impact of label noise, and that the optimal dropout
probability increases with the level of noise in the data. Our results are
validated by extensive numerical simulations.
